Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter\\'s latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due '"

Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter\\'s latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due \\nTL;DR:\\nDANIEL RADCLIFFE: I\\'m not going to be an extravagant young man.

            "Data: ['(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids\\' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won\\'t consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl\\'s seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. \"Marijuana...?\" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, \"I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing.\" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn\\'t. Instead, she added, \"You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering.\" I don\\'t think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to \"turn around.\" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first \"Weed\" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn\\'t know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn\\'t even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in \"Weed 3,\" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When \"Weed 2: Cannabis Madness\" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer\\'s, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. \"This time will be different,\" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn\\'t take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .', \"He looks barely teenage. But this child has amassed thousands of Twitter followers with his pictorial updates of 'gang life'. The baby-faced boy from Memphis, Tennessee, poses with guns, cash, and bags of what looks like marijuana. Scroll down for video . Baby-faced: This little boy has amassed more than 3,000 followers on Twitter with pictures like these . In many pictures he is smoking suspicious substances, with captions such as 'High Life' Backlash: The boy, from Memphis, has prompted a wave of critics calling his stunts 'sad' In one video he laughs and points the gun at the camera in an apparent attempt to look menacing - as adults laugh in the background. In others, he is pictured blowing smoke, with the caption: 'High Life'. Tweets include the phrases, 'I need a bad b****', 'f*** da police', and 'gang sh** n****'. Some feature sexual references, such as: 'quit suckin my d***'. As he is a minor, DailyMail.com will not identify the little boy. The child's tweets have prompted backlash from other Twitter users and members of the community. One woman tweeted him: 'you need help i feel so bad for you your parents should be ashamed please get help and a education this is sad and disappointing.' Another Twitter user said: 'You poor baby. Just stop it & go to school.' Adults around: Many of his pictures and videos are taken with adults who are seen laughing, unfazed . Guns: The little boy, who appears to be barely teenage, regularly poses for his followers with guns . The boy hit back at his critics claiming he has had a tough year and the backlash is 'stressing out' his mother . Orrden Williams, a Memphis resident who has been the victim of gang violence, told AOL.com: 'What he's doing on here is something that he's going to bring upon society one day. It's just inevitable.' He added: 'All it takes is the right influence, and all this can change. So that's a wake-up Memphis call right there.' Hitting back at critics, the boy tweeted on Friday: 'Wish some people would mind dey own business' as 'it's stressing my mama out'. He adds that his sister has 'been locked up for two years' and his critics 'don't know the half of what we been through end of 2014 & beg of 2015.' Authorities are increasingly cognizant of Twitter as a means of perpetuating gang culture. While many like this young boy use it as a forum to flaunt their drugs and guns, around 50 per cent of organized gangs maintain in the United States maintain a social media profile.\", 'New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn\\'t looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state\\'s largest teacher\\'s union is calling him out for his \\'bullying\\' behavior. \\'He\\'s always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,\\' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. \\'It\\'s the one thing that never seems to change.\\' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn\\'t ring well with Christie\\'s ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie\\'s motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state\\'s pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as \\'favoring the affluent\\' and \\'kicking state workers under the bus\\'. \\'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,\\' Mooney said. \\'Do you?\\' a defensive Christie quickly responded. \\'You do know that? Really? You know that?\\' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie\\'s decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . \\'I mean: Do you know that?\\' Christie continued. \\'I wanna know how you know that. Because you\\'re a teacher, and you\\'re standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.\\' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting \\'to be bullied\\'. \\'You\\'re not being bullied, because you\\'re asking me a question, I\\'m going to ask you questions back,\\' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. \\'He said, \"I\\'m not bullying you\\' as he bullied her,\"\\' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie\\'s town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. \\'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,\\' Christie said Tuesday.', \"YouTube star Cassey Ho has hit back at critics with a powerful and provocative new video, highlighting the cruel comments left by viewers of her fitness-focused clips who accuse the trim and toned online icon of being everything from ‘too fat’ to ‘ugly’ to ‘pudgy’. Cassey's YouTube channel, Blogilates, has over two million subscribers, so fans may have been surprised to learn that the negative comments left under the California resident’s fitness videos still manage to get under her skin – and have a much greater impact on her than any of the positive messages sent to her by her fans. But though mean and critical messages may have put a dent in the 28-year-old’s self-esteem, the workout pro is getting the last word with her latest video, The 'Perfect' Body, which examines just whether conforming to society's standards is the key to happiness, while highlighting some of the cruel comments she has received from viewers of her YouTube videos. Scroll down for video. Fighting back: In her new video, Pilates instructor and YouTube star Cassey Ho combats body-shamers who comment on her videos . She's only human: Seemingly full of confidence, Cassey said even she has felt bad about herself after reading nasty comments calling her 'fat' online . In a post on her Blogilates blog, Cassey said negative comments on her videos are nothing new, but the flood of nastiness has grown especially bad lately. She added that the trash-talking has even brought her to tears on more than one occasion. 'It’s hard to be content with the shape of your body when people are constantly telling you how fat you are, how much weight you need to lose, how much weight you need to gain,' she wrote. 'What do people want?' Cassey goes on to explain that, through her new video, fans can see what it's like to face that kind of negativity, and watch as her own self-esteem gets 'stripped away', leaving her feeling insecure and ashamed about her appearance. Fit or fat: The slim and toned blogger says that the negativity in the comments section of her YouTube channel has become especially nasty lately, and has even made her cry . Peanut gallery problems: In the new video, Cassey picks at her body, honing in on places that commenters say she could improve upon . The video begins with Cassey posting a selfie in gym clothes, taken just after a workout. She immediately starts to read the comments, and though they start off positive, soon people are telling her she shouldn't give fitness advice because she is fat. Cassey goes on to strip down to her underwear, examining, pinching and prodding her body, using the spiteful comments to direct her to different parts of her physique that people insist need changing. And as the video goes on, she grows more unsatisfied with herself as negative comments pop up around her. So the YouTube star gets to work, manipulating her body in a simulation of real-life Photoshop. She thins her thighs, hips, and waist, makes her butt and chest bigger, and even changes the color of her eyes. Finally, she posts another selfie of her 'improved' look - achieved with the help of a body double - but she is clearly still unhappy, and she uses this feeling to try and show viewers that giving in to body-shaming will only leave you worse off. Before and after: The fitness expert's body goes under a major transformation; Cassey used a body double to achieve the final look . Moral message: Even after making her butt and chest bigger and her waist and legs smaller, Cassey still doesn't find happiness at the end of the video . No Photoshop here: The retouching in Cassey's video was meant to prove a point - she doesn't use Photoshop in the photos she posts online . It seems that her 'take that' attitude has left her detractors speechless. Readers of her blog flooded the comments section of the latest post with overwhelmingly positive feedback. 'Thank you for standing up to this struggle for girls and women everywhere,' wrote one fan. Another chimed in: 'I absolutely applaud that you are your natural, beautiful self. I think you’re a wonderful inspiration for young people.' Cassey hopes viewers who relate to the video's message will share it in an effort to battle body shaming and cyber bullying.\", \"British taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook has confirmed he plans to compete for Moldova at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Dorset-born Cook, 24, who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has now received his passport from the small eastern European state. 'I will soon begin a new journey representing the Republic of Moldova at all International competitions and hopefully the Rio Olympic games and beyond, should I qualify,' Cook wrote on his Facebook page. Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain \\xa0since May 2012 . The British taekwondo star has been granted citizenship by Moldova and plans to fight for them in Rio 2016 . 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'I am a fighter at heart and I am not going to throw away 20 years of dedication because of bureaucracy.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, felt he was overlooked for London 2012 - when Lutalo Muhammad, who was selected instead, won bronze - because he decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Cook is aggrieved at being overlooked in favour of Lutalo Muhammad, who won bronze at London 2012 . GB Taekwondo has always denied this, but Cook has refused to compete under the British flag since May 2012 and has fought for the Isle of Man since early 2013. 'It has been an amazing couple of years full of memories, and I would have loved to continue competing under the Isle of Man banner,' Cook said. 'Unfortunately that was never going to be possible as it was made clear to me in May of last year, after winning the European Championships for the third consecutive time, that it would not be possible for me to be selected for Team GB, regardless of my world ranking or performances. Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Cook hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June having served the mandatory three-year period since representing a previous country. However, the British Olympic Association could yet block the move and Sportsmail understands it is still in talks over the matter.\", \"As the countdown continues to Floyd Mayweather's mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2, The Money Man's daughter Iyanna Mayweather has shared her thoughts about life in training with her champion father.

The Arsenal manager will have a heart-to-heart chat with the forward ahead of Saturday’s crunch top-four clash against Liverpool. Walcott was hauled off after 55 minutes of England’s 1-1 draw in Italy on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott struggled for England and Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned by the winger's confidence . Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday . 2 -\\xa0Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool’s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: ‘Yes, I’m worried about Theo’s confidence. He’s sensitive and I’m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt . ‘He’s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. ‘At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. ‘I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask “how did it go?”. We always speak about the last game. ‘He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. ‘He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. ‘He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.’ Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin — a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. ‘Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,’ said Wenger. ‘Theo’s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He’s not a guy who provides. ‘I don’t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It’s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. ‘I didn’t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say “Walcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front”. That’s an initiative they took on the pitch.’ Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12. Dyke believes increasing the number of British players in squads will help contribute to a more successful England team. But Wenger said: ‘I believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth. ‘Secondly, I’m happy to, and would like to contribute to the quality of the English national team, but you have two questions you can raise before that. ‘First of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in England and it didn’t improve too much the performances of the national team. ‘Secondly, if between the ages of 16 and 21 the England youth teams win every single competition in Europe then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level. Wenger believes there are flaws in FA Chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to increase the homegrown quota . ‘That is not the case, on the contrary. I think between 16 and 21 the English youth teams, until now, have not performed. So that’s the heart of the problem. ‘Let’s get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. ‘I think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high. I still believe when they are good enough, they play. ‘You speak about Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Nobody stops the quality, no matter where they are from.

An Australian doctor who calls himself 'Abu Yusuf' is geatured in the latest Islamic State propaganda video in which the terrorist organisation announces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic\\xa0Britain's National Health Service . The vision, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows Yusuf interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,’ he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. ‘It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. ‘We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' The video also features an Indian physiologist called Abu Muqatil al-Hindi, who says the physical therapy centre is ‘one of them most important areas that any hospital should have.’ The physiologist says there are already Australian physiologists in the wing, but he encourages more doctors to travel to Syria to help the struggling medical service.

Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. ‘I’m familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. ‘The video is interesting because it’s trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.’ ‘In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.’ Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. ‘They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren’t trying to lure them for militant purposes.

But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George’s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a \\xa0British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by\\xa0locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in  Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's  homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad\\xa0during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany’s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left.\\xa0People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw.

Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of\\xa0Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times\\xa0reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known. Her father Lachhu, who lives in Gudibanda with Duli's mother, said child marriage was a common phenomenon in their society. He told the Hindustan Times\\xa0that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show. Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate.

Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s.

Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal \\xa0is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today .

'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014.

Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\", '(CNN)Sunday\\'s announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the \"predator colleges\" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It\\'s no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam\\'s student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can\\'t afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here\\'s the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation\\'s college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison\\'s sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It\\'s deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn\\'t easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a \"debt strike,\" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, \"victim\" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can\\'t even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What\\'s even more frustrating is that we\\'ve known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, \"It\\'s not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,\" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on \"federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions\" on potential buyers. You can\\'t hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it\\'s time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it\\'s up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don\\'t go back to school in the fall.

A former Syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions at his home. Faris Al-Khori had dozens of chemicals, poisonous materials, bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb, a court heard. The equipment was\\xa0found purely by chance in April last year after a fire at a block of flats in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh. Firefighters, who were\\xa0responding\\xa0to a 999 call over a fire within\\xa0a rubbish chute on the 11th floor, had forced entry to a flat registered to Al-Khori and found jars containing various powders. Castor beans, which can be used to make ricin, were also found. The building was evacuated while the police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old. Al-Khori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the Forensic Explosives Laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed. A search was carried out at a further block where the 62-year-old lived with his wife in Leith and a further haul of material was recovered. Both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off. Al-Khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in February he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act. Police seized bomb-making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit (pictured) from the properties . Two Coleman's Mustard jars were found being used to store\\xa0a small amount of a highly volatile explosive, lead picrate . Sentencing him to three years and four months in prison, Judge Lady Wolffe said: 'You assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area. 'The number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.' The court heard that\\xa0much\\xa0of the bomb-making equipment, which also included electrical circuits, had been ordered from online retailers. Defence QC Brian McConnachie said: 'What seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies, mainly through Amazon. 'The material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to Mr al-Khori. 'It has always been done in the open and over a period of time. Many of the items have never been opened. Al-Khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients . 'It is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials. 'It seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything.' Detective Superintendent David Gordon, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a significant and complex inquiry for Police Scotland, to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish Al-Khori's motives for storing them. 'A thorough investigation by the Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit and Crown Office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe Faris Al-Khori was acting independently. However, he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings. 'Thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the Fire Service and armed forces, we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion. The items from the flats in Edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered . 'I am also grateful to the City of Edinburgh Council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches. 'Public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public. 'Al-Khori's activities went unnoticed for many years, demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep Scotland safe. 'Counter terrorism is one of Police Scotland's highest priorities, and whilst Al-Khori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified.' Al-Khori, who was born in Damascus and raised in a Christian family, trained as a doctor in Iraq but has never practised medicine in Britain after arriving here in 1984. He was the full-time carer for his wife, who suffers from schizophrenia, and has had British citizenship since 1998. Police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials . Lindsey Miller, the Crown Office's Procurator Fiscal for Organised Crime and Counter-Terrorism, added: 'The conviction of Al-Khori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public. 'Al-Khori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in Edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives. 'We worked closely with Police Service of Scotland and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that Al-Khori was brought to justice.' 'I want to reassure the people of Scotland that we take any such offences extremely seriously, and our specialist prosecutors will continue to treat them as an absolute priority.'\", \"David Cameron will say that high taxes are 'immoral' as 14 million working households receive a tax cut .

And that’s what today is all about.’ He will add that it is ‘wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees’. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub ‘money back Monday’, are: . Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to £15,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of £17 a month. And nearly million pensioner households – more than nine in ten – will benefit by £15 a month. Middle income households earning around £23,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a ‘better and fairer place to live’, adding that low taxes ‘go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. ‘For me, there’s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. ‘There’s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. ‘But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong – frankly immoral – for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.’ He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit ‘without reaching into working people’s pockets like Labour would’. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they’ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? ‘The truth is millions are worse off because of this government’s choices. ‘And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a £3billion a year tax cut.’ Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are £1,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes . The Lib Dems said that the changes to income tax had been part of their manifesto and said Labour would cost 24million taxpayers £340 a year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: ‘In government, we secured a tax cut totalling £825 every year for millions of ordinary working people. We now plan to take this further, raising the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold to £12,500 and giving millions of people a further tax cut worth nearly £400.’\", \"Police say they have no objections to the late afternoon kick-off for Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford. With plenty at stake for both United and City – both sides are challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League – some may feel that the 4pm start could be unwise as it allows supporters more time in the pub. However, the man in charge of patrolling the sell-out clash has no such fears. Police say they have no objections to Sunday's Manchester derby taking place in the late afternoon . Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side. 'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday’s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.' Rio Ferdinand was hit by an object thrown from the crowd during the Manchester derby in December 2012 . In February, Merseyside Police launched a legal challenge after the Everton v Liverpool match, which was also televised, was chosen for a 5.30pm start although they later withdrew their objection. Police in Manchester have met representatives from supporters groups representing each club and agreed a series of measures. Inside the ground fans in and close to the away end will be limited to two drinks every time they visit the bar. No street drinking will be allowed while police will also be searching supporters and keeping an eye out for pyrotechnics. GMP also say they have no intention to hold back City supporters at the final whistle but add that this could be reviewed on the day. Footage on You Tube showed the unrest when United played City in a late kick-off at Wembley in 2011 . City won that FA Cup semi-final, but 34 arrests were made due to crowd trouble outside the stadium . The last time United and City met in a late kick-off for a weekend match was in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in 2011. That clash, won by City 1-0, started at 5.15pm and was marred by a series of skirmishes on Wembley Way and on coach parks close to the stadium with 34 arrests made amid scenes some fans described as 'a free for all'. The last late afternoon kick-off in Manchester was for a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in 2004. After November's derby at the Etihad Stadium, won 1-0 by City, video footage captured dozens of fans fighting outside a nearby pub around 90 minutes after the final whistle. In April 2012, Vincent Kompany's header settled the derby in a match that was played on a Monday night at the Etihad Stadium.\", \"Crawling commando-style underneath an open-sided Land Rover, I came virtually nose to nose with a 4,500lb horned rhino. I tried to slow my breathing as she looked straight at me. I needed to be calm to take my shot. There were three other rhinos with her and, let's be honest, they're not called a crash of rhino for nothing. I raised my camera and began to photograph what could soon become an extinct pachyderm. The luxurious Ulusaba Game Reserve is  in South Africa's Sabi Sands and is Sir Richard Branson's private reserve . Thankfully the female found my scrawny presence of absolutely no consequence, and instead wandered off in search of tastier herbivorous options. I was with my mate James and we laughed awkwardly as we climbed back into the vehicle. My mum – Sky TV presenter Kay Burley – was sitting statue-still on board, having adopted her best nonchalant expression, but she wasn't fooling either of us. The holiday at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands, was my reward for graduating. I have been on safari before but this was different. I'm an amateur car photographer and wanted to swap taking photos of Ferraris and focus instead on the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo, the prowl of a glorious leopard or a close-up of a fearless rhino. We achieved all of them. Kutner came face to face with three rhinos, along with documenting the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo and the prowl of a glorious leopard . Just the day before, we had tracked the crash of rhino on foot. With 1,000 rhinos killed by poachers in South Africa last year alone, they are increasingly difficult to view. Danny, our brilliant tracker, who could find a spelling mistake in a dictionary, had eventually located them, but with dusk fast approaching we reluctantly headed back to the Land Rover. The African bush is not a place to be on foot in the dark. We should know. We'd spent the earlier part of the day up close and personal with a pride of lions. Our ranger, Trevor, steered the Land Rover as close as he dared without disturbing the big cats. The lioness, who could have taken any one of us out with a casual swipe of her front paw, looked in our direction, checked her cubs and allowed us to stay. Trevor, also a photographer, whispered advice on appropriate settings for my Nikon D600 to achieve the best results. Heading back to the luxury accommodation at Cliff Lodge, a two-bedroom apartment within Rock Lodge (Mum described it as glamping but with solid walls, luxury furnishings, soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food), we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see, if possible. Alexander Kutner with mum, Sky TV presenter Kay Burley, at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands . Trevor said he and Danny would try but couldn't promise anything. Nevertheless, given the conservation, ecology and anti-poaching work being carried out by Ulusaba and adjoining camps, we were feeling confident. The following day we found ourselves slap bang in the middle of a herd of buffalo, mean-looking guys who glare at you as if you owe them money. Danny, who will happily track on foot for lion, leopard, elephant and rhino – four of the Big Five – makes an exception for buffalo. Alexander said a lioness looked in his group's direction, checked her cubs and allowed them to stay . Trevor started up the engine and we moved on. Pausing at a watering hole, we were delighted to see two young male elephants wandering towards us. They made their way into the water and proceeded to perform for us – a photographer's dream! We returned to the lodge to relax and sort through the hundreds of photos we'd captured. Chef served up kudu burgers for lunch.\\xa0We'd seen plenty of these handsome antelope during our morning game drive… and Mum decided to pass on that meal. Ulusaba means 'place of little fear'. That's because the koppie where Rock Lodge sits provided the ancient Shangaan warriors with the perfect lookout point . Trevor wondered what else we'd like to see. 'Cheetah, please,' we cried. He took us on a long, bumpy drive to the wide-open plains where cheetah can run free in their hunt for food. They are extremely rare in this area of the Sabi Sands and, despite hour after hour of tracking, there were no paw-print clues. However, Trevor had one last surprise. Danny heard the call of a honey bird and a solitary warning from an impala antelope. These led him on foot to a pair of leopard cubs frolicking up a tree. There is no sighting quite as magical as a leopard, and six-month-old cubs are the perfect age to provide incredible images of their playful behaviour. Eventually, with a heavy heart and my camera packed away, we left the African bush. Until the next time...

Anna Moser\\'s daughter Sharista Giles of Sweetwater, Tennessee, was driving home from a concert in December with friends when a car accident sent her to the hospital with injuries so bad doctors believed she would never recover. She was five months pregnant at the time and in January doctors were forced to deliver the baby early, a little boy the family has named Leighton Isiah Giles. Scroll down for video . Twenty-year-old Sharista Giles (left) of Sweetwater, Tennessee, went into a coma in December after a car accident.

It was worth the risk, the bad treatment and the fear, hard as that may be to believe. Simply put, I have a better life now than I did before. But my journey across the Mediterranean, like those of thousands of other migrants, wasn\\'t easy. Here\\'s my story. It all started late last year when I lost my job in Dubai. My work visa had expired, and I had nowhere else to go. I\\'m Syrian, and returning to Syria wasn\\'t an option -- going back means you either have to kill or be killed. But Syrians don\\'t need visas to get into Turkey, so Turkey it was. I arrived in the country in December with an old dream in my mind: reaching Europe. While in Istanbul, I discovered many Facebook pages about illegal smuggling from Turkey to Italy by sea. All of them mentioned that Mersin, a port city on the southern border, was the jump off point, so I made my way there. I met a Syrian guy in a hotel in Mersin who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days. He told me his smuggler was a decent man with a great reputation. Reputation: It was a funny thing to hear for the first time, the thought that these people, who I always considered to be little more than criminals, were concerned about what people thought of them. But why wouldn\\'t they be? It\\'s a long-term business, and the Syrian conflict isn\\'t ending anytime soon. So I decided to meet the guy. We spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $6,500. Some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company, with the usual transaction fees. When I reached Italy the money would be released to the smuggler -- or, if I changed my mind, I\\'d be able to get some of it back. \"Be ready all day, every day for the next few days, because you might receive the call to go,\" the smuggler told me. One evening a few days later, I got the call and my journey began. They gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point. It was far from Mersin. We walked for 30 minutes, through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach, in darkness to avoid detection by police. The idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship. I still remember an old lady, barely able to walk, with her two sons, marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats. They were told that if they didn\\'t walk faster, the boat would leave without them. I asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger. I decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things. Finally we reached the boat. It was just as the smuggler described. For three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing. We were in the middle of the Mediterranean, far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters. On the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy, ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate, nameless numbers who never made it to the other side. But there was no going back -- it\\'s a one-way ticket. We sailed for eight hours before the boat\\'s engine broke down. There were around 300 of us on board, and as the waves began to push us towards Cyprus the crew sent a distress signal, hoping to alert maybe a U.N. or Red Cross boat, anyone who could help us. Eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck. Luckily, before long, a Cypriot coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to Turkey. Turkish authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours. Some of the people I had been traveling with said they weren\\'t going to try to make the trip again. When they asked me what I planned to do, I told them I would do it again tomorrow if I could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works, where no one is bigger than nature, where you can feel so small, no matter how big your dreams are. I\\'d already lost everything. My family didn\\'t know what I was doing, but I dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one. I wasn\\'t going to stop. So I called the smuggler the same night I was released, and said I wanted to get on the next ship out. Two days later I received the call, and again I headed to a smuggling point. This time, they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship, in fact, maybe 85 meters long or more. It took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total, refugees from cities all over Syria. And for the first time, I began to feel like I was in jail, trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer. We lived in the hold. There were no mattresses or sheets, but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet. Hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes . For five days we had no food and little water. But at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the \"toilet,\" if you could call it that, which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth. Huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship, the smell of urine emanating from the corner. Seven days in, despite the poor conditions, everything was going well and we were nearing the island-dotted seas near Greece. On the eleventh day, 200 miles off the coast of southern Italy our guides began to alert Italian authorities to our presence. We were adrift at sea, they told the authorities, with no captain or crew. And that was actually true -- we didn\\'t have a registered pilot, just one guy who had worked on this ship before. An Icelandic ship -- working in conjunction with Frontex, the joint European Union border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from New Zealand. The rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high. We knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever. The other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other: \"Stop waving, they\\'ve already seen us.\" I was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat. I can still see it like it was yesterday; it was the rebirth of a new life. Why migrants head to Mediterranean . They took us to Catania, on Sicily, where we finally reached land a day later. When we arrived, the first thing the Italian authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases. There was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat, a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention. They took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted. They were saying: \"We didn\\'t risk everything to be refugees. We are not going to give our fingerprints, even if they torture us.\" Later that night a Moroccan-Italian man told us not to worry: \"They will not fingerprint you.\" They would simply take us to different camps and we could leave from there. Twelve days after it began, our journey to Europe was over. I spent two days in Sicily before making my way first to Milan with two Syrian guys who had become friends. We decided to go to Germany and went to Paris first and ended up in a city called Saarbrucken. I didn\\'t know where my fellow travellers were heading, but I knew one thing: my dream of making it to Europe, no matter the cost and risk involved, had been achieved. It was worth it.', \"Leicester City midfielder Esteban Cambiasso knows what it feels like to claim football's biggest prizes but says saving the Premier League strugglers from relegation would be one of the highlights of his career.

Penalties: Lozowski (2) Referee: George Clancy (Ireland) Toulon are back-to-back continental champions, awash with Test talent, but they were given a scare by their tenacious opponents — and even forced to adopt sly, illegal tactics to survive a second-half fightback. Seven minutes from full-time amid a cacophony at Stade Felix Mayol, Wasps launched a daring raid from their own 22 which eventually culminated in a second try for Will Helu, but it also featured a miscarriage of justice. Former All Black lock Ali Williams pulled back Elliot Daly off the ball as he ran clear in support of Joe Simpson. It was surely one of the most obvious offences of its type ever committed in the sport, yet Williams not only avoided a yellow card, but he was on hand to touch down three minutes from time for the try which distorted the final scoreline. Wasps were left battered and beaten, but richly deserving of the ovations from their pockets of supporters around the ground. Captain James Haskell’s work-load was worthy of three men and Andrea Masi also gave body and soul to the cause, while Simpson and Daly were outstanding.

Young was delighted with how his side had performed, once they stopped being so deferential. ‘I’m really proud of the effort and the commitment,’ he said. ‘There was real frustration in the first half, because we gave them a bit too much respect in the first 30 minutes. We were a little bit frantic, a little bit panicky, but we will learn from that and I thought we played some really good stuff on occasions.

When Williams went over to quell the uprising moments later, it secured Toulon a semi-final against Leinster in Marseille, and left Wasps to head home craving another shot at this tournament next season.\", \"Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls in. Trott last played a Test for his country in November 2013, when he withdrew from England's disastrous Ashes tour with a stress-related illness. But his much-anticipated return, this time as captain Alastair Cook's opening partner, was over almost before it had begun when he nicked Jerome Taylor to Darren Bravo. Jonathan Trott trudges off the field after being dismissed for a duck in his first game back in the Test team . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott in the first over as England slumped to 1-1 after just five balls . Trott, usually a middle order batsman, had been preferred to Yorkshire's Adam Lyth, still to make his England debut, and moved up to the top of the order. But the gamble failed for the Warwickshire man, who has worked hard to prove he still has the quality to play Test cricket since his Ashes withdrawal the winter before last. The wicket left England one for one after just five balls after being put into bat by the West Indies in the first Test in Antigua. Trott was making his first Test appearance since his Ashes turmoil against Mitchell Johnson 18 months ago .\", \"A Briton jailed in Burma for using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar has been ‘abandoned’ by the Foreign Office, according to human rights campaigners. Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting the mocked-up image of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. The tongue-in-cheek advert for a cheap-drinks night at the VGastro bar in Rangoon provoked outrage among devout Buddhists. Scroll down for video . Phil Blackwood (left) was sentenced to two-and-a-half years with hard labour by a Burmese court last month after posting a mocked-up image of Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook. Human rights campaigners claim he has been 'abandoned' by the Foreign Office . The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar’s Burmese owner and another manager, despite apologising profusely for posting the picture. All three were given the same sentence. MPs and human rights campaigners said Mr Blackwood, who is married with a young daughter, is enduring appalling conditions in the notorious Insein prison. They also claimed the British Government had ‘turned its back’ on Mr Blackwood, who lived in Middlesbrough until his family moved to New Zealand when he was four. The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion because of this picture . In a Commons answer, a Foreign Office Minister admitted he was not aware Mr Blackwood was a British citizen. Last night, his father Brian insisted that the family had informed the British authorities of his son’s dual nationality after his arrest. Although New Zealand diplomats were taking the lead, he said that the family expected the Foreign Office to exert pressure on Burma. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald said: 'Philip Blackwood has been unjustly imprisoned for an honest mistake for which he has already issued a heartfelt apology. 'As a British citizen, rather than turning their back on Mr Blackwood, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should be pulling every available leaver to secure his immediate and unconditional release so that he can return to his family.' There is international concern over a surge of religious nationalism in Burma, ruled until recently by a military junta. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘Our ambassador in Burma made clear that we were following the case closely when he raised it with the Burmese Minister of the Presidency. ‘Our embassy in Rangoon has provided advice and support to the New Zealanders on Mr Blackwood’s case.’\", \"Ronald Koeman called for Southampton's players to show maturity, nous and respect after Victor Wanyama's future came under question. This weekend brings with it arguably Saints' biggest match of the season, with the visit of Tottenham likely to be key in the fight for European qualification. Mauricio Pochettino's first return to St Mary's adds extra spice to a match, ahead of which his successor felt the need to hold a team meeting to refocus his players' minds. Ronald Koeman says his Southampton players must remain focused on European qualification . Koeman spoke to Victor Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games . Wanyama's claims that Arsenal were interested in his services were the catalyst and, while defending the 23-year-old by saying the story was 'bull****', Koeman called for his players to show more common sense. 'You know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players,' the Saints boss said. 'I don't like to say every time it's true or it's not true. 'It's important that everybody knows his position in the club. They have contracts - you can't talk about moving because you have a contract. That's not respectful to the club. 'We spoke about that, that we need that focus. If we don't have really that focus, we can't bring the level what we normally bring this season.' Such speculation about the likes of Wanyama, Nathaniel Clyne and Morgan Schneidelin brings back memories of last summer's talent drain from St Mary's. Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to Arsenal . Koeman has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around, although he is wise enough to know the south-coast club's place in the food chain. 'On one side it's normal because, okay, we are Southampton,' Koeman said. 'We are not Man United, because they are always talking about new players, and normally in teams like Southampton, a little bit more down, they are talking about interest in players of Southampton. 'We know that, but it's up to the press. They can write and they can say what they want, but no problem. 'We have to keep that spirit together and that was my message to the players. 'We can't do anything about that. You have to look out if they ask you that kind of questions. That's your job. There has also been speculation about the futures of Morgan Schneiderlin (left) and Nathaniel Clyne . Southampton come up against former boss Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday in the race for the Europa League . 'You're not a young kid. You have to respond, and if you respond you have to know what you respond.' Koeman says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents. The former Holland international also understands the ambitions his players may well harbour, admitting he spoke out of turn a few times when he was younger. 'Of course, when I played in Holland, okay, I was looking to play in a bigger team - that's normal,' Koeman said. 'If you are not really in the highest level and you get opportunities to play in a higher level, okay, you like it, of course. Everybody likes the best. 'Everybody likes to play Champions League football - that's normal. I'm not surprised about that.'\", 'A Wisconsin church\\'s four-decade tradition of people mud-wrestling pigs at a summer fundraiser has been cancelled after complaints the animals were \\'punched in the face, body slammed and jumped on\\'.

Depay, 21, jetted to England with representatives including his agent Kees Ploegsma for a summit with a United delegation led by manager Louis van Gaal. United are leading the hunt for the pacy Holland international but face opposition from Paris Saint- Germain while Liverpool have also expressed an interest. Memphis Depay had a secret meeting with Manchester United as the club look to tie up a move . Depay during a photo shoot back in October 2013 where he modelled the Can-Am three-wheeled bike . Manchester United are hoping to leave their rivals behind in the race to sign the young winger . PSV coach Phillip Cocu admitted: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach and the Premier League is great' Van gall refused to squash the reports in his weekly media briefing. When asked about the Depay link, Van Gaal said: 'I don’t discuss it with the media, you know my answer. 'I have a lot of relationships with players. I cannot buy all the players I've coached already.' Van Gaal, who worked with Depay at the World Cup, made inquiries over the player's availability last summer but decided to keep track of his progress rather than make a move. That could prove to be a costly decision, with the Dutch club looking for around £25m for his services after he scored 20 goals in 28 games. Depay, who has 'dream chaser' tattooed to his chest and is pictured here modelling a three-wheeled bike in October 2013, could line up at Old Trafford next season. PSV coach Phillip Cocu was unaware of the meeting when asked on Friday. He said: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach with whom I have worked and he was always very pleasant and the Premier League is a great league. 'I have contact with Memphis on a daily basis about many things, but not on a specific club or league.' United hold the upper hand in the hunt for Depay thanks to Van Gaal, who worked with the player during his stint in charge of Holland. PSV appear to be resigned to losing their star man this summer. Depay has become one of the hottest properties in European football after a blistering season . Louis van Gaal (right) was tempted to sign Depay last summer and will have to fork out around £25m . Depay, who often plays on the left wing despite being right-footed, has been compared with international team-mate Arjen Robben. However, Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.'\", \"Floyd Mayweather Jnr's personal chef responsible for fuelling the the fighter ahead of his $300million clash with Manny Pacquiao has revealed her boss does have some weaknesses when it comes to food. Quiana Jeffries, aka Chef Q, was brought into Mayweather's camp after driving through the night to impress him with a trial breakfast. A regimented diet is crucial to the champion's training regime and Mayweather demands organic produce, although there are a few exceptions. 'Twizzlers are his favorite,' Jeffries reveals in an interview with New York Magazine. Floyd Mayweather Jnr (left) insists on eating organic food before his fight, although there are exceptions . Chef Q has been cooking for Mayweather since his fight for Manny Pacquaio was announced . Fried turkey dogs are specialty southern dish of Chef Q's that Mayweather loves to indulge on .

Who do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao? Who do you think WILL win the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao? Now share your opinion . 'And Top Ramen (dried noodle packets).\\xa0'It's what he had growing up. He likes them crunchy, with a lot of noodles, and not a lot of juice,' she adds. However, Mayweather's most unhealthy food craving has got to be 'fried hot dogs... with barbecue sauce'. Jeffries explains that she tries her best to ake them as healthy as possible: 'I cut them longways, and fry them up in a little coconut oil. I spice that up the barbeque sauce, too. 'I add a oranges, orange zest, and other spices. He loves barbecue sauce. Everything with barbecue sauce. But that's life. You like what you know.' As well as unusual eating requests, Jeffries also has to cope with Mayweather's unconventional timekeeping. The 38-year-old does not followed a structured training regime and prefers to decide when he does things according to how he is feeling, which can pose problems for his 24-hour chef who charges around £1,000 per meal. 'If Champ wants a meal at three, four, five, six in the morning, I have to be ready for that,' Jeffries said. 'He's called me at four and says, 'I want that oxtail.' Finding organic food stores in the early hours of the morning is also challenging, especially in Las Vegas. Mayweather and Pacquiao are just days away from their $300m mega-fight in Las Vegas . Jeffries explains how she is yet to find a farmers' market in the city and is restricted to a handful of 24-hour supermarkets, but not all departments stay open all night. 'The seafood counters always close early,' she says — leading her to befriend managers to acquire the necessary ingredients for Mayweather's favourite seafood gumbo. 'They all know who we work for.'\", \"It wouldn’t make much of a breakfast, but this tiny egg could give a schoolgirl and her pet hens a place in the Guinness Book of Records. Shannon Hayes, 12, believes one of them has laid the smallest chicken egg in the world. After doing some research on the internet, she thinks its length of 1.8cm – smaller than a 5p coin – shaves two millimetres off the previous title-holder. Shannon said: ‘I’m confident it’s the smallest. It is very tiny and you wouldn’t want it for breakfast.’ Shannon Hayes, centre, believes her pet hen, right, has laid the world's smallest ever egg, left .

She keeps seven hens at her family home in Capel Iwan, Carmarthenshire, but she is not sure which laid the tiny egg. Shannon spotted it among the ordinary-sized eggs in her hen coop. Fearful of it being crushed, she immediately took it into the house to be measured. In 2011, an American farmer claimed his hen had laid the world’s smallest chicken egg, measuring 2.1cm long. That was beaten in 2014 by an egg one millimetre smaller laid in Somerset by a hen called Muffin. Meanwhile, Shannon is storing her potential world record-breaker it in the fridge for safe-keeping. Shannon believes that her egg, which measures just 1.8cm in length is 3mm smaller than the current record .\", \"The never-ending chaos at Leeds continued on Friday as six players withdrew from Saturday's game at Charlton citing injury. Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury . It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries . Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time. Leeds were not available for comment.\"]\n",

There were no Luis Suarez nutmegs this time but the former Chelsea defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as Neymar scooted past him for Barcelona’s opener. Neymar (top) celebrates with Brazilian compatriot Dani Alves after scoring his and Barcelona's second goal of the night . Neymar accelerates past another Brazil teammate, David Luiz, before opening the scoring for Barcelona on Tuesday night .

Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Digne,  Bahebeck. Booked: Luiz. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves’ cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar’s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant – to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

Great Britain's tennis No 1 Andy Murray (left) was at the Nou Camp alongside his friend and former tennis player Ross Hutchins . PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique’s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn’t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca’s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals. The prospect of Barcelona and Bayern being drawn together on Thursday is mouth-watering. Although perhaps on current form, and in view of his side’s injuries, Guardiola might prefer to leave the reunions for Berlin on June 6.

The New York Post reports that Jerry Hugel, 83, his wife Marianne Hugel, 80, died along with 70-year-old neighbor Gloria Greco, and friend Walter Vondthadden, 76, in an apparent carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly caused by a car left running in a garage. Scroll down for video . Married 60 years: Neighbors say that Jerry and Marrianne Hugel were a happily married couple for 60 years who loved to dance, garden, and observe their German heritage . Cleaning up: Police Department personnel remove one of the bodies from a home where four people were found dead on Friday . It appeared the car was accidentally left running in the garage, but it was unclear for how long, investigators said. Neighbors lined the streets and sidewalks in the suburban neighborhood next to Long Island's Nassau County. Some cried as police officers and firefighters walked around the Cape Cod-style, two-story home. Before police officially identified the victims, neighbor Helga Harter told The Associated Press that the couple was named Jerry Hugel and Marie Hugel, who were in their 80s and had known her for 40 years. 'They were wonderful people,' Harter said through tears as she stood on a street corner, looking at the home. 'They were married for 60 years.' Heartbroken son: Robert Hugel was checking in on his elderly parents on Friday when he found them dead due to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning along with two of their friends . Medical aid: Emergency personnel gather near a home where police say four people were poisoned to death . The Hugels had five children, including son Robert Hugel, a New York Police Department officer who was said to have found his parents lifeless bodies. She described them as a 'great family' very active in the local German community. She last saw them on Wednesday at a Bavarian dancing class they attended together. 'I'm in shock,' Harter said. 'It's the greatest shock of my life.' The Hugels had lived in the home for 40 years, and an elderly woman lived upstairs as their tenant, Harter said. No visible trauma was observed on the victims' bodies, police said. Carbon monoxide, an odorless and colorless gas, is created when some fuels are burned. Hugel was found in the seat of his car in the garage and his wife was found in the room directly next to the garage, reports The New York Post. The scene: \\xa0Police stand outside the floral park home where four elderly people were found dead and where to windows are now wide open in an attempt to ventilate the apparent fume filled house . The couple’s friend, age 73, had been seated in the living room and the tenant, who sources said was older than 60, was found on the second floor at the top of the stairs. Neighbors were heartbroken after hearing about the deaths. 'It looks like it was accident, someone just forgot to turn the car off,' a source told The New York Daily News. 'The windows were air-tight, so there was nowhere for the gas to go.' 'It is very surreal,' said Barbara Stoja. 'We knew them for over 35 years. They were very fun people, they were dancers.'

'They were such nice people, it’s really sad,' said Melissa O'Reilly, whose parents have lived on the block for three decades. 'They are a really nice family, everyone loves them, just good people, their kids are very nice.' O'Reilly said she knew the family for about 30 years. 'I grew up here, we always called them Mr. and Mrs. Hugel,' O’Reilly said. 'They have lived in that house before my parents moved here, and that was 30 years ago.' The deaths come on the heels of other deadly carbon monoxide incidents that killed at least 10 people on the Eastern Seaboard in recent weeks.

Prosecutors said a utility company had shut off power at the home on Tuesday and a gas generator was being used there without proper ventilation. There was an inoperable carbon monoxide detector in that home, they said. City Councilman Mark Weprin, who represents the area including Floral Park, said he hoped the tragedy would shed light on the importance of having and maintaining carbon monoxide detectors in all homes and apartments. 'My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and families of the victims,' \\xa0he said in an emailed statement.

Ryan Giggs is pictured in an adidas shirt, the Barclays Premier League side last wore adidas shirts in 1992 . That means that unless United remain in America until August 1 - a week before the start of the season - fans will have to wait to see the new kit while their team continues in what will effectively be an old ensemble. As reported on Wednesday, the tour will be shorter than last year's epic trek across the country and is likely to be confined to the west coast thanks to input from manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman, who pays ferocious attention to detail, vowed that a repeat of last summer would not happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Louis van Gaal has had a big input on United's pre-season plans, restricting the US tour to just 12 days .

The Labour leader used a speech in Edinburgh to claim the Tory election campaign has descended into 'desperation and panic', as some polls put Labour ahead across the UK. But Mr Miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in Scotland, 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour, robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority. Scroll down for video . A poll of Scotlans shows 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour . There has been a surge in support for the SNP in the months since the independence referendum in September . In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. The new YouGov poll for The Times shows Labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007. The SNP is up three points to 49 per cent, a record high. Support for the Conservatives was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the Liberal Democrats was up one point at 4 per cent. The results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted'. 'The polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the SNP is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the NHS and public services is winning support across Scotland.' Ms Sturgeon has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7. However, the SNP leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for Scotland in return, meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SNP's plan 'will mean a £7.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances' In a joint press conference, Mr Miliband was joined by his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . The SNP has proposed 'a modest increase in public spending' to end austerity and allow Scotland's health budget to rise by £2 billion by 2020. 'Let us lift austerity and have spending increases in the next parliament that are fiscally responsible but allow us to spend more money on our vital public services like the health service,' she said. 'I am proposing an increase in spending in the health service across the UK that would see by the end of this decade an additional £2 billion being spent on the NHS in Scotland. 'That's the choice we have at this election - continued austerity being proposed by the Tories and Labour, or an alternative to austerity, which is what the SNP is proposing, and we need a strong Scottish voice in Westminster that can force that alternative to austerity.' But in a joint press conference, Mr Miliband, his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP's plan 'will mean a £7.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances'. Mr Miliband said: 'Today I challenge Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to say how they will fill this GBP7.6 billion gap. Which services will be cut? Which taxes will be raised? And what cuts will it mean for pensioners in Scotland when they are taken out of the UK pensions system? 'The SNP claim in this campaign to be proposing no reductions in spending, but in fact they are planning dramatic reductions in spending.\\xa0They must now come clean.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in Sterling today, has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7 . Ms Sturgeon joined with local candidate Steven Paterson while on the campaign trail in Stirling . The latest poll results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted' Mr Miliband pledged: 'I will never sell Scotland short by signing up to the SNP's plans. And I will never sell Britain short by abandoning the pooling and sharing of resources. Because this is a pooling and sharing which benefits all parts of our country, because we look after each other and we know we can only tackle the problems our country faces across the whole of the United Kingdom.' Speaking ahead of Mr Miliband's speech, Ms Sturgeon claimed that Labour was 'wrong' in its analysis. 'This is desperation on the part of the Labour Party,' the SNP leader said during a campaign visit to Stirling. 'Instead of putting forward a positive case of their own, they are resorting to the same fears and smears that they resorted to during the referendum. 'The truth is, the only cuts on the horizon for Scotland are the ones that the Tories are proposing and Labour are backing.'\", \"A young waitress has claimed that England footballer Aaron Lennon grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top as he partied in the VIP suite of a nightclub.

A teenage waitress claims England footballer Aaron Lennon (pictured playing for Everton) grabbed her, slapped her and ripped her top . After taking part in Everton's 1-0 win at home against Southampton on April 4, Lennon is thought to have headed to Suede nightclub in Manchester with friends. Lennon, who has 21 England caps, lives in a penthouse apartment in the city centre. That night, the venue, which is popular with Premier League footballers, was packed with hundreds who had come to see singer Trey Songz perform. But later in the evening, the waitress claimed to have been attacked by the player in the VIP section - where booths cost £2,000. She was interviewed by Greater Manchester Police four days later. A source told\\xa0The Sun's\\xa0Michael Hamilton and Dean Wilkins that the girl, who is 'very pretty', had worked at the club for just under a year.

The former Spain international played for 148th time in the competition, more than any other player since the tournament changed to its current format in 1992. Xavi also set the record for the most appearances in the knockout phase of the Champions League having now featured in 53 matches in the latter stages. Xavi made his 148th Champions League appearance against PSG on Tuesday night . Former Spain international Xavi shares a joke with his former team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic after the game . They are not records that the 35-year-old is likely to hold on his own for long, however. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas is in line to equal Xavi's total in both Champions League games and knockout matches when Carlo Ancelotti's side take on Atletico in the second leg of their quarter-final on Wednesday night. While, Casillas' team-mate Cristiano Ronald will join Xavi on 53 knockout appearances if, as expected, he plays against Atletico.

Xavi (centre front) lines up for a Champions League clash against Manchester United in 1998 . Barcelona's safe passage to the semi-final was secured with a 2-0 win against the French champions as Neymar Jnr netted twice in the first half at the Nou Camp to give the Catalans a 5-1 aggregate win. Their progression gives Xavi the opportunity to play a further three times in the Champions League this season, should Barca reach the final. This is likely to be the midfielder's last season playing in the competition as he continues to be linked with a summer move to Qatari club Al Sadd, with reports in Spain suggesting he will sign a three-year deal. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas can equal Xavi's Champions League appearances - all time and in the knockout phase - if he faces Atletico on Wednesday night . Cristiano Ronaldo will also draw level with Xavi for knockout stage appearances if he features on Wednesday . Casillas, meanwhile, has to help Real Madrid overcome their local rivals at the Bernabeu if he is to have any chance of adding to his appearances this season. Though the Spain goalkeeper is almost certain to pass his former international team-mate next season. Casillas has been linked with a move away from Real Madrid but joining a club playing in the Champions League would be a prerequisite for the experienced keeper.\", \"The first dramatic footage of the Hatton Garden jewellery heist shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery \\xa0- as it is revealed police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm. The six-strong gang dressed in high-vis jackets were captured on CCTV working throughout Thursday night having successfully broken into the\\xa0basement of the building in the heart of London’s jewellery district. Shockingly, the footage reveals they returned again on Saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping. Scroll down for video . The Mirror has obtained the first pictures of the six-strong gang which raided Hatton Gardens last week . Images obtained by the Daily Mirror\\xa0reveal the precise timings of the raid for the first time - as well as the fact they used wheelie bins to remove millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe. Scotland Yard tonight refused to confirm to MailOnline whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the Mirror, but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm. The footage begins at 9.23pm – just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit centre lock up for the Easter weekend – as the first thief appears on camera carrying a black bin bag. It was unclear exactly where the cameras were situated, but at least one is aimed outside the building and shows a white van thought to be the getaway vehicle. Over the following four nights, half a dozen raiders are seen lugging heavy-duty tools, including massive bolt cutters and a red monkey wrench down to the secure vault. Each member of the gang is wearing builder’s overalls and high-visibility vests. At least one has a balaclava over his face, while others wear dust masks – but each one is partially reconisable. The first raider to appear has been dubbed Mr Ginger after the colour of his hair. Another, wearing a builder’s hat, has been referred to as Mr Strong and is seen carrying steel supports that may have been used for the diamond-tipped drill that police say cut through into the vault. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The Tall Man – who wears an Adidas tracksuit – carries two red tools up and down the stairs. Another, dubbed the Old Man because of his grey hair, later appears to struggle for breath in the footage as he lugs bags from the vault. Two other raiders have been nicknamed The Gent, for his smart brown shoes, and Mr Montana because he is wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word. Reports say that he has a shaved head, and possibly an earring in his left ear. At about 9.40pm the gang disappear into the building. At 7.52am on Good Friday, according to the footage, members of the gang can be seen again. The street camera captures the white Transit pull up to the alley. On Sunday, at around 6am, the gem thieves can be seen dragging heavy wheelie bins and several black bags back up the stairs. It has been reported these contained potentially millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables. The last trace of the raiders is recorded at 6.44am on Easter Sunday, when a white van pulls up and the gang load it with all the remaining equipment and disappear. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Another suspect, riding a moped, may also be connected to the gang. The raid was not discovered until the following Tuesday . The thieves apparently thought they had covered all their bases when covering their footsteps, but had failed to realise they had missed the cameras. A source told the Mirror: 'This was clearly the work of a professional gang who planned this job down to every last detail. 'But they may have made a mistake in leaving this footage behind.' The footage came to light as Scotland Yard was forced to admit it did not respond to a burglar alarm triggered during the raid - which could make it liable for million in compensation. That\\xa0failure to investigate immediately left the gang free to work uninterrupted over Easter and escape with gems and cash worth ‘millions and millions’ from 70 deposit boxes - as can clearly be seen in the video. Officers were informed that the warning had been triggered shortly after midnight on Good Friday. But they decided that the possibility of a burglary did not need immediate investigation. Instead, a private security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the building. Last night, jewellers who rent boxes with the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd security firm accused the police of incompetence and threatened to sue them and the owners of the deposit company. One jeweller, a 63-year-old named Michael, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned the police have got a lot to answer for. Suing anyone is a last resort but it’s something I would consider.’ A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . Another jeweller called Ryan, who runs a business with his father in Hatton Garden, added: ‘It is just unbelievable that they could ignore a call from an alarm company.’ The deposit firm has also faced criticism over the building’s ‘antiquated’ alarm system. Security expert Seamus Fahy, 47, said: ‘It was a well-planned heist, but the lack of modern technology made it a lot less difficult than it should have been.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. ‘It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.’\", \"Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker.

Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry . Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season .\", \"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has become the first governor in five years to visit Cuba, following President Obama's ease on trade and travel to  the communist nation.

Obama loosened the trade embargo early this year with a series of executive actions that allow easier U.S. travel to Cuba, more remittances to the island and, at least on paper, U.S. exports to support the island's relatively new private business sector. Obama also moved to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror, removing a barrier to access to the global financial system. Cuban officials have been pushing Obama to go further with measures that could include more specific federal licenses for U.S. businesses to trade with Cuba in ways currently prohibited. 'The president of the United States has the ability to grant licenses to businesses so that businesses can actually start developing right now in select areas and those are areas that we want to pursue,' Cuomo said.

His weak backbone means he can't stand or walk and is  restricted to a sitting position.\\xa0Mahendra can just about crawl but needs help to eat and go to the toilet. Undiagnosed: Mahendra Ahirwar's parents say they would rather see him dead than suffer the way he is now . Mahendra's mother\\xa0Sumitra Ahirwar, pictured here with her son, says watching his life is 'devastating' His father Mukesh Ahirwar, 40, and mother Sumitra Ahirwar, 35, who both work as labourers when they can, say they have consulted more than 50 doctors across India but none could diagnose his condition. ‘I cannot see him suffer anymore,' said Sumitra. 'Watching his life is devastating. 'He cannot do anything by himself. He just sits in a corner of the room all day. It's no life.' She added: 'I have to carry him like a baby everywhere but he is 12 years old, how will I carry him when he grows even older?' ‘If doctors cannot treat my son it is better that God takes him.’ Shockingly, members of the community have blamed Mahendra's condition on Mukesh's past sins and believe he is to blame for his son's disability. Sumitra, who also has healthy 16 and 10-year-old sons and a 14-year-old daughter, did not visit a doctor when she was pregnant with Mahendra.

The couple only noticed their son’s head was starting to hang when he was about six months old. 'At first we thought he was just a little weak and he'd be fine in time, but by his third birthday he wasn't able to keep his head upright at all,' his father explained. Mukesh, who earns about Rs200 (£2) a day on construction sites, has\\xa0borrowed money from his friends and relatives to help find medical treatment for his son. But he said two years ago he decided to stop taking Mahendra to see any doctors, adding: 'I took him to all the hospitals that I could afford. 'Even India's premier hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences  in New Delhi, but after spending two weeks there doctors failed to tell us if my son could be treated. ‘With a broken heart we returned home and decided to raise him and try to give him as comfortable a life that we can.' Mahendra pictured with his father Mukesh (left), \\xa0mother Sumitra (seated) and brothers Lalit (centre) and Surendra (second from left) Sumitra has now lost all hope of a treatment being found for her son and says: 'If doctors cannot treat my son it is better that God takes him' Mukesh added: 'People say bad things about him, and they often laugh at him. It really hurts us. 'We cannot tolerate people's attitudes and discrimination. They say I must have committed some terrible sins and this is why he is suffering, it’s awful.' Mahendra doesn't go to school so his only friends are his siblings and his cousins. Dr Shashidhar Tatavarthy, an ear, nose and throat consultant at Delhi's Artemis Hospital, thinks Mahendra has a muscular disorder. He said: ‘This is one of the rarest of rare cases. His condition could be due to a spine anomaly or muscular disorder, but it can only be concluded after a thorough investigation.' Mukesh is still hoping for a miracle. 'If doctors can treat babies born with severe disabilities like two heads and give them lifesaving operations then why not my son?' he said. 'I still have so many hopes and dreams for him. I want to see him go to school and play with other kids. I want to see him living a normal life and I am hoping that my wish will be fulfilled one day.'\", \"A hardware store worker has been found guilty of ejaculating in his female colleague's coffee in a bid to get noticed.

Liverpool have to stop the supply line because defending crosses has been their Achilles heel this season. Christian Benteke (centre) scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11 . Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel (right) will have his hands full trying to stop Benteke on Sunday afternoon . FABIAN DELPH v JORDAN HENDERSON . This should be a good contest between two England team-mates. Fabian Delph’s new deal was a real boost for Villa - he drives that midfield, though he doesn’t get enough goals. You used to say the same about Jordan Henderson but he has improved so much. England international Fabian Delph (left) and Jordan Henderson are set for a midfield battle at Wembley . RAHEEM STERLING v RON VLAAR and NATHAN BAKER . Ron Vlaar and Nathan Baker make an imposing back line but they would rather be up against a Benteke than a Raheem Sterling, who will float around and make himself difficult to mark so he can use his lightning pace to get in behind them. Raheem Sterling's (left) pace and trickery is bound to cause the Villa defence a lot of problems .

The Brazil international has been criticised by Jose Mourinho in recent weeks and there are question marks over his future. Chelsea want to strengthen in the summer and may need a high profile departure to help balance the books. Juventus and Liverpool are interested in signing Chelsea 23-year-old midfielder Oscar . Oscar in action during Chelsea's 1-0 Premier League victory against Queens Park Rangers last weekend . Oscar cost Chelsea £19.35m and they would want a substantial profit on the 23 year-old. Paris Saintt Germain have shown interest in the past also. Juventus want a playmaker for next season and Brazil boss Carlos Dunga advised them to buy Oscar. 'He reminds me of Roberto Baggio,' he said. 'Oscar has technique, reads situations well and is a modern and versatile trequartista. He reminds me of Roberto Baggio, but also has similarities to Massimiliano Allegri. The former Sao Paulo youngster has struggled to make an impact for Chelsea this season . Brazil coach Dunga (pictured) revealed the Chelsea midfielder reminds him of Roberto Baggio . 'Brazilians like to have fun with their football, which hasn’t happened to Oscar very much recently, but I met Jose Mourinho and he spoke highly of all his Brazilian players. 'I tell Allegri that Oscar is strong and also a good lad. A forward line with him, Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata would drive any Coach crazy. 'It wouldn’t be a step backwards for Oscar to go to Juventus. He’d be decisive in Serie A and whether he plays for Juventus or Chelsea it’ll always be a great club.'

Both centre-backs' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely Distin, who is 38 in December and has played more for the under-21s in the last month than he has the first team, will be retained. Alcaraz, 33 in July, has more of a chance of securing a short-term extension as Martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer. Roberto Martinez insists 37-year-old defender Sylvain Distin still has time to prove he deserves a new deal . Antolin Alcaraz, who joined Everton from Wigan where he played under Martinez, could get a new deal . While the Toffees boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway the two most likely to benefit - he has not ruled out retaining existing senior players. 'There are only two players out of contract and we have two loan players (Aaron Lennon and Christian Atsu) and those decisions will be made when we have finished the season,' said Martinez. 'The next six games could have a massive bearing on that. Ninety minutes is a big opportunity to change people's views. 'All individuals will be judged over that period. In football it does not matter if you have a contract or not, you always need to improve and show the right attitude and show you are ready to be part of the future of the club. 'But when you get players at the end of their contract there are decisions to be made and it is not just the club, it is the player as well.' Roberto Martinez says his club's recruitment team have been searching for targets for six months . Distin has played more for Everton's youth team than the first XI in the past month, and could be on his way . Martinez said they have established a list of transfer targets for the summer and, while he would not confirm publicly, Aston Villa's on-loan Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley, out of contract at the end of the season, is believed to be one of them. 'The recruitment department has been working really hard over the last six months and we need to assemble a really strong squad,' Martinez said. 'First and foremost it is an opportunity for young players to show they are ready for big important roles for next campaign and everyone else providing strong competition to be important figures for the future. Tom Cleverley, who is on loan at Aston Villa, is a target, with Martinez having worked with him before . 'The dressing room is very strong as it is now, so we need to make sure whatever we do in the summer is to get us in a better place. 'We know the situation with Tom. He is a player that I know well having worked with him (in a previous loan spell at Wigan) - and that's it. 'Tom is a player that is at the moment fighting for something very important for his club and that deserves respect. 'I wouldn't expect anyone to speak about my players and I would never do that.'\", \"More than 25 women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy. One ship - HMS Ocean – even had five pregnant sailors removed in emergency 'medevacs' during the last nine years, a Freedom of Information request revealed. And at least one woman was airlifted from HMS Illustrious, which was nicknamed 'HMS Lusty' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year. More than 25 women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy, including\\xa0at least one woman from HMS Illustrious (above), which was nicknamed 'HMS Lusty' by the crew before it was decommissioned last year . Eighteen other ships - including HMS Dragon, HMS Enterprise and HMS Richmond - had emergency evacuations, data obtained by The Sun showed. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict 'no touching' rule in place at sea, which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave. The data comes nine months after commander Sarah West, the first woman to captain a Royal Navy warship, was flown back to the UK following claims she had a sexual relationship with a member of her crew. An unnamed captain was appointed in her place and a military investigation was launched into the 42-year-old's conduct. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed there was a strict 'no touching' rule in place at sea, which suggests the women conceived before boarding the ships or during leave (stock image above) Navy sources said Ms West left HMS Portland for ‘personal reasons’. The Ministry of Defence would not confirm what these reasons were or what action she would face. Women have been serving on Royal Navy ships since 1990 and in 2014 around 9 per cent of personnel were female. Last May three women made history by becoming the first female submariners to serve in the Royal Navy. Nearly 100 female British soldiers were sent home from Afghanistan after finding out they were pregnant. Ninety-nine servicewomen on operations were flown back to the UK between January 2006 and December 2013, a Freedom of Information request revealed. Sixteen women were removed from Afghanistan in 2013 due to pregnancy while 18 were sent home in 2011, the data showed. A further 102 women were evacuated from Iraq. Strict military rules ban mothers-to-be from serving in war zones. The women were flown back on flights usually reserved for injured troops and the true figure could be higher if others travelled via routine flights. Troops are reminded by senior officers to check they are not pregnant before they fly to the front line - but are not made to do pregnancy tests. Most of the babies would have been conceived before the mother left the UK but a small number of women may have become pregnant on tour. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said at the time: 'The small numbers of personnel who discover that they are pregnant on operations are returned at the first convenient opportunity.'\", \"Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League.

The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented, with declines in tourism and the seafood industry, as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region. Since then, the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery. In fact, reports indicate that the Gulf of Mexico\\'s seafood industry, which supplies the United States with roughly 40% of its seafood, is finally starting to rebound. However, profound challenges remain, in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered. To this day, it\\'s still unclear where all of the oil went, exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating. One of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the Gulf crab. Crabs play an important role in the region: Roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the Gulf in 2012, earning tens of millions in revenue. Yet in the aftermath of the spill, changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye. Researchers documented substantial differences in appearance, and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints, forcing limbs to fall off. These traits have affected not only the crabs\\' market value but also likely their ability to survive. While these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term, the health of these crabs could still be precarious. I have been working with colleagues at Florida International University and University of Louisiana at Lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill. Using the power of genomics and computational biology, we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the Macondo Prospect where the Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab. By studying gene expression, the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell, we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and, based on the types of changes we might see, clues as to how the crabs respond. Although we are still in the early stages of our research, we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant. We are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce. It\\'s not just Gulf crabs that are experiencing changes. Research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill. This not only has consequences for the Gulf area, where oil drilling continues, but also for communities along the Atlantic Coast, where the Obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration. (BP\\'s vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, told CNN that wildlife species in the Gulf have \"bounced back and \"there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\") With the virtual certainty of more spills, we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently. The U.S. Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are making some progress. In coming months, they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon spill. But government agencies cannot just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis. Instead, the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing, long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what \"normal\" looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill. Only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources.', \"A 10-year-old boy who beat a younger child to death in Canada went to his friends claiming that he had witnessed a 'big guy' strike the victim with a rock. Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma to the head in August 2013 following a savage attack on a reservation in Saskatchewan. A 10-year-old boy, identified in court documents as L.T., reportedly admitted to killing Lee Bonneau and crushing his head after initially blaming a stranger for the slaying. Slain: Lee Allan Bonneau was 6 years old when in August 2013 he was attacked by a 10-year-old boy and beaten to death with a rock and a stick . Brief life: Lee was pronounced dead from severe head injuries four hours after he went missing in Saskatchewan, Canada, while in the care of his foster mother . Tribute: A collage created by Lee's biological family celebrating his short, troubled life . On Thursday, a coroner's jury in Regina heard how the underage suspect ran to his friends after the attack on Bonneau telling them he had witnessed a murder, reported National Post. The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also excited, telling his friends how a 'big guy' had struck Lee with a stick three times, pushed him down an embankment and then bashed him with a rock. L.T. then changed his story, according to Thursday's hearing, saying the he was the one who killed the 6-year-old. He then pleaded with his pals, 'Don't tell on me,' because he was afraid of being jailed. During an interview with investigators a day after Lee Bonneau's slaying August 21, 2013, L.T. reverted back to his original version of events, telling Royal Canadian Mounted Police that a 'big person' committed the crime. The 10-year-old named the purported killer and told law enforcement officials that he even walked up to the man and asked him what he was doing. 'I'm just killing a little boy,' L.T. quoted the man as saying. Police later questioned the person identified by L.T. and cleared him of any wrongdoing. On the evening of August 21, 2013, Lee Bonneau accompanied his foster mother, Mary Ramstead, to a bingo game at the Kahkewistahaw First Nation hall. At around 8pm, Lee stepped outside the bingo venue to buy snacks and never returned. He was last seen playing with some dogs and walking in the company of an older boy, later identified as 10-year-old L.T. More than two hours after his disappearance, Lee was found critically injured in a remote field more than half a mile from the bingo hall. A coroner's inquest has heard how a 10-year-old boy named L.T. attacked the younger child, pictured here as an infant on the evening of August 21, 2013 on a reservation . Family troubles: Lee was removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk (pictured) just two and a half months before his murder . Lee is pictured here with his birth father, Dave Bonneau. Child servers reportedly refused to release the 6-year-old into his parent's care . The 6-year-old was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries at around midnight. Forensic pathologist Dr Shaun Ladhman determined that Lee died from blunt force trauma to the left side of the head after suffering multiple skull fractures. In his testimony at the coroner's inquest Thursday, Ladhman compared the boy's injuries to those seen in high-speed car collisions or a three-story fall. Bonneau also had bite marks on his body. Because of his young age, 10-year-old L.T. has not been charged with Lee Bonneau's murder. Global News reported that Saskatchewan’s children’s advocate determined the underage killer had severe behavioral issues and likely required constant supervision. RCMP Cpl. Donna Zawislak testified court that when officers came to the child's house and said that Lee Bonneau has died, the 10-year-old did not react. The following day, L.T. sat down for a forensic interview, saying he had been a witness to the killing, not the perpetrator. When asked about the blood stains on his clothes and shoes, the 10-year-old blamed it on a nosebleed. The child had a history of troubling behavior, including a break-in where he killed a pregnant dog and her puppies, which had been cut out of the animal's body. Lee had been removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk, just two and a half months before his death citing concerns related to his verbal skills and behavioral problems. Violent end: A pathologist testified that 6-year-old Lee suffered injuries often observed in high-speed car collisions. He had multiple skull fractures and bite marks on his body . Lies:\\xa0The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also, telling his friends after the killing how a 'big guy' had struck Lee . Unpunished:\\xa0L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age . During the coroner’s inquest, Ms Merk testified that a social worker became alarmed when she confided in her that she has been struggling with depression and had suicidal thoughts. On August 1, child services placed Lee with Mary Ramstead's family on a temporary basis. Three weeks later, the 6-year-old was murdered while in the care of his foster mother. L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age. The goal of the coroner's inquest is to determine the circumstances of the murder and make recommendations to prevent similar tragedies going forward.\", \"He was, as one ECB board member put it, just too accident-prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an Ashes whitewash. Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton . OCTOBER 2013 . Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014 . After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen’s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to ‘create a culture’ in which captain Alastair Cook had ‘the full support of all players’. MARCH 2014 . England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014 . Downton appoints Peter Moores, who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at Lancashire, for a second spell as England head coach. MAY 2014 . Downton and the ECB issue an apology to Pietersen for claiming he appeared ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney. JUNE 2014 . England lose a Test series at home to Sri Lanka. The south Asian side had previously won on English soil in 1998 — in a one-off Test match. JULY-AUG 2014 . England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014 . Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015 . England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015 . Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of ‘director of England Cricket’ ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England’s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. ‘Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,’ one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. ‘He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.’ Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton’s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen’s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role . Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while\\xa0Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role . Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton’s departure . Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England’s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Moores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference . Downton speaks with Sir Ian Botham  at Lord's Cricket Ground on May 31, 2014 . Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter’s Ashes disaster. England’s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday’s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new ‘Director of England cricket’ might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician . Verdict: Vulnerable . Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket. Selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well-publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players, spectators and media . Verdict: Sure to follow Downton out the door . England selector James Whitaker (left) and former managing director Downton during a nets session . Peter Moores . An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer’s Test series win against India. Described as ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’ by Downton, Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been. Verdict: Vulnerable . Peter Moores’ position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton’s removal, and Giles Clarke’s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible . Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much .\", \"Detectives probing the suspected murder of a landlady who disappeared 17 years ago have dug up the patio of her pub.

The search has the full consent of the present landlord who is not connected with the investigation . The same month Deborah's sister Gini Secker, 47, from Nottingham said the unsolved case was a 'heavy burden' for her family. She said: 'I find it so very sad that our father went to his grave without knowing the truth of Debbie's whereabouts. 'It has been a heavy burden to carry all these years and all we wish for is the answers so we can lay Debbie to rest at last.' A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Police today said: 'The search is being undertaken with the full consent of the present landlord, who is not connected with the investigation.'

After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, while the pair joyfully flap their ears and caress each other with their trunks  in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary, in the north of the country. Me-Bai was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. Scroll down for video . It would appear to be true that an elephant never forgets, based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart (pictured) It is particularly sad because females tend to stick together in herds until they die, sharing incredibly strong bonds. They are very rarely separated before the calf is five years of age. The small elephant left the tourism trade 'because she [Me-Bai] was too young [and] began to lose weight and could not carry the tourists any longer,' according to Elephant News'\\xa0YouTube page. Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after a tiring 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. The small elephant was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. They are pictured here togeher . Asian elephants remember old friends and have large social networks of friends, a 2011 study found. Researchers claimed that just like humans, some elephants are social butterflies, while other prefer to stick to a close-knit group of friends. Past studies suggested elephants usually live in small groups centred around females and their young while adult males live independently. However, the study found that though males do live apart, females and their young actually have the sort of complex network of friends, relatives and acquaintances normally seen in humans. Study author Dr Shermin de Silva from the University of Pennsylvania said: 'Elephants are able to track one another over large distances by calling to each other and using their sense of smell. 'So the 'herd' of elephants one sees at any given time is often only a fragment of a much larger social group. 'Our work shows that they are able recognise their friends and renew these bonds even after being apart for a long time.' 'Me-Bai was nervous and wary of people when she first arrived at the sanctuary, but she quickly learned that her new caretakers had no intention of abusing her in any way,' the sanctuary writes. She was initially wary of humans but quickly adjusted to her new surroundings,\\xa0National Geographic reported. Workers learned that Me-Bai's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire Mae Yui so she could join her young at the sanctuary. The emotional moment the pair were reunited was captured on camera. It shows the elephants caressing each other with their trunks and flapping their ears – seemingly in joy - after spending an uncertain half an hour together where the keepers thought they may be worried about being separated again. A previous study conducted at the park by Mahidol University in Thailand and Emory University in the US, found that elephants comfort each other when they are stressed by chirping softly and stroking each other's heads and genitals. These actions can be seen in the video. Psychologist and elephant behaviour expert, Preston Foerder, of the University of Tennessee, said the elephants are communicating with touch, as well as sound and sight, because their trunks are so sensitive. The duo can be seen walking and eating together happily, later in the video. After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small calf can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, and joyfully flapping her ears in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary in the north of the country . However, animal behaviour expert Frans de Waal of Emory University, said that it's possible the elephants don't remember each other, but are just a compatible pair. 'There is no doubt about elephant feelings and bonding, but we humans like to read the mother-child relation into this,' he said. 'It is possible the two remember each other but the video itself does not necessarily prove this.' Whatever the case, the sanctuary says: 'Now, Mae Yui's owners and Elephant Nature Park are working together to rehabilitate Mae Yui and Me-Bai so that they can return to the wild and live free.' Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after an exhausting 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. Here the pair walk towards each other at the sanctuary . Workers learned that Me-Bai's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire Mae Yui so she could join her young at the sanctuary .\", \"Military officials in Kazakhstan have introduced a Miss Army competition in the hope of encouraging more recruits.

Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area, according to a source. The Welsh schoolboy, who was formally named by police today, was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri, elder brother Gerwyn, 19, and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place. A seven-year-old British boy has died after getting separated from his parents on a family skiing holiday in the French resort of Flaine near Geneva (pictured above). He fell down a 160ft cliff after trying to find his parents . Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family. Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine. One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts. His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search. At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis. He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff. The area was described as a 'dangerous, out-of-bounds area' by emergency services, who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body. The conditions in the French ski resort of Flaine (pictured) were clear and sunny but it is believed the boy ventured off-piste while trying to find his parents. Police found tracks in the snow which led to his body . Michel Ollagnon, an officer with the Bonneville mountain rescue service, told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother, brother and sister, but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day. He said the boy had then fallen off a rocky outcrop after apparently losing his way. Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, added: 'His family were on the piste and then they could not see him. 'They looked for him but couldn't see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: 'Our child has disappeared' and a search was started. 'At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous, out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy's skis. 'They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff. So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were then winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.' He added: 'Hypothetically we think that the little boy didn't know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven years old. 'He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell. 'He fell 50 metres. Specialists are now at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.' Resort boss Sylvain Philippe, director of the Societe du Domaine Skiable de Flaine, said: 'The whole resort has been affected by the death of this young boy. We are thinking above all of his family. 'An enquiry into his death has started to find out the exact circumstances of what happened. Unfortunately and sadly they confirmed that his body was found off piste in an area of the resort called Aujon. 'He was very far from the piste, it's not a skiable area. He was unfortunately found in the middle of the cliffs, everyone has been very affected by it. 'We're working with the police and the family on this and we will be helping the family for as long as they need.' Carwyn's mother Ceri lives with her husband Rhys in the Brecon Beacons where the pair run the award-winning Coity Bach Farm near Talybont-on-Usk. The farm rents out its 'four-star gold award' self-catering cottages to visitors and is well known for its prize-winning speciality sausages. David Cameron was once pictured buying scotch eggs from the couple's stand at an agricultural show in Wales in July 2014. On the Coity Bach website it tells how ex-nurse Ceri and former butcher Rhys bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'. Last night, relatives at the farm were too upset to speak, but a neighbour told of the village's shock. 'It's extremely sad – they are a loving family and he was a smashing lad,' said one neighbour, who did not want to be named. They went on to say: 'I haven't even broken the news to my own children yet, it's just too shocking.' Another added: 'Ceri is a great mum and they're well-loved in the village. We will all rally round her when they return from France.' An assistant from Ski Set, a shop in the resort where the family had hired some of their equipment, said: 'They loved skiing. They said that they had been to lots of ski resorts before. 'They were a very nice family. The little boy seemed just happy to be on holiday. They had been on holiday for a week. He was good enough for a seven-year-old. He wasn't a beginner.'\", \"Manny Pacquiao says he has to fight Floyd Mayweather like it is the last of his life when he touches gloves with the undefeated American in the $300m bout on May 2.

The horse, Charly, was patrolling Venice Beach with his minders on Tuesday when the vandalism incident occurred. It was broad daylight, and somehow the person managed to spray Charlie without the handlers seeing - a move that taggers pride themselves on, but usually with stationary objects and facades. 'I think it's unfortunate, but people love to tag things in Venice, so really, I guess a horse is just the next step,' local Mark Stegall told CBS\\xa0LA. Vandalized: Charly was patrolling Venice Beach with\\xa0with his minders Tuesday when the cruel tagger managed to write 'RBS' and an arrow on the horse's flank with silver spray paint . 'It's cruel and it's not respectful,' another local, Robert Kendall, said. 'It's bad for the animals and it's just people who want to mess with the status quo and I think it's pretty awful.' However, tags are cryptic signatures, and authorities are hoping they will be able to track down the person responsible using the tag, which was 'RBS'. A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram. All clean: The paint came off relatively easily, but police are still trying to find the person responsible . 'RBS': The key to finding the tagger likely lies in deciphering the tag, RBS, and working out who it belongs to .

Destruction: An estimated 150,000 people died when the US bombed Hiroshima, obliterating as much as 70 per cent of the city (pictured in 1945) Pilot: The incredible lot is being put to auction by the son of Captain Robert Lewis (pictured) who was on the Enola Gay that fateful day . The collection also includes a hand-drawn diagram, the pilot of the plane that bombed Hiroshima was told to arrive at 30,000ft, drop the payload two miles short of the city, then veer away sharply at 28,500ft. The previously unseen documents used to plan the dropping of the world's first atomic bomb on Japan on August 6, 1945, in a bid to end the Second World War have emerged for sale 70 years on. They are among a £300,000 archive compiled by Captain Robert Lewis, co-pilot of the Enola Gay B29 bomber, which also includes his flight logs and report of the bombing raid. One plan, drawn in pencil and coloured inks on a single sheet of blue graph paper, shows how the Enola Gay would approach Hiroshima, drop the atom bomb – nicknamed Little Boy – and then turn 150 degrees to the right to return. The plan also shows the air burst at under half a mile up over the city and the subsequent shockwaves that the explosion would create. A second plan, titled 'survival manoeuvres', expands on the initial diagram to show the flight paths of support planes The Great Artiste and Necessary Evil. The diagram concludes with a handwritten note: 'Caution – stay at least 2/3 miles away from the atomic cloud at all times.'

But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars  could still harbour extra-terrestrials. While it sounds like science fiction, these planets may offer scientists a new avenue in their search for alien life. The warmth of a sun has long been thought to be a key ingredient to life. But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials . This is according to Sean Raymond, an astrophysicist with the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux in France, who has taken a look at how life can form on rogue planets. Writing in Aeon, he says: 'To have any chance of life – at least life like our own – a free-floating Earth would need liquid water.' A planet needs to keep warm for liquid water to form, and without the sun, this heat would have to come from its interior. 'A layer of ice on a planet's surface can act as a strong insulator, locking in a planet's heat,' claims Raymond. Globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make rogue more common than first thought.\\xa0Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star . PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 light years away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter . Several years ago, an\\xa0international team of astronomers discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit. Planets traditionally travel in a uniform, singular direction, around a star. However, the free-floating planet, named PSO J318.5-22, was found without a host. Its movement isn't structured, and scientists do not understand how it formed and they are baffled by what - if anything - controls it. PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 light years away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter. Astronomers believe it formed 12 million years ago, and is considered a newborn in planetary terms - Earth is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old. Dr Michael Liu of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii identified the rogue planet from its 'faint and unique heat signature'. We have never before seen an object free-floating in space that that looks like this. 'It has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars, but it is drifting out there all alone,' explained Liu. 'If the ice layer is thick enough, then a planet can maintain an ocean of liquid water beneath the ice.' He calculates that the ice layer needs to be at least 10 km (6 miles) thick to prevent it from freezing for billions of years. Raymonds comments echo a similar conclusion reached by scientists in Chicago several years ago. They calculated that life can cling on to a planet for billions of years without a star to provide a direct source of warmth. Research by astrophysicists Dorian Abbot and Eric Switzer from the city's university discovered that heat would come from the breakdown of radioactive elements inside the planet's core. The scientists named their discovery a 'Steppenwolf' planet because they claimed any life found there would 'exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe'. However the pair refused to speculate on what life forms would be discovered, but agreed that they would me microscopic in size. As well as internal heat, Raymond says another way a planet can keep warm is using a thick atmosphere. 'A free-floating Earth with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could keep its surface temperature above the freezing point of water,' writes Raymond. 'The planet could have lakes and oceans (and possibly life) on its surface.' Rogue planets are hard to find because, without orbiting a star, they reflect very little light. But 50 have now been found in the past 15 years, leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe. Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star. Brown dwarfs, for example, are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain fusion, but are still more than 13 times the mass of Jupiter. The exact boundary between a giant planet and a low-mass brown dwarf is still being debated, but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery. And this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos.\", \"This is the terrifying moment a woman drives the wrong way down a highway and plows into oncoming traffic in an apparent suicide attempt.

The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 each week. A fundraising page on mycause\\xa0was set up to help the struggling family, which at the time of publication\\xa0raised more than $18,000. 'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said. 'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent. 'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes. 'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi. 'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.' Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder. According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide. About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia. 'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states. The condition is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is more commonly discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications. Symptoms include:\\xa0global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual impairment, seizures, marked hypotonia (floppiness), hearing and/or vision impairment, difficulty in feeding and oesophageal reflux, congenital heart defects, apnoea, prominent high forehead, coarse facial features as child gets older, broad nasal bridge, streaks or patches of lighter or darker skin, sparse hair or bald patches, high arched or cleft palate, shorter arms and legs, disproportionate to the body and extra nipples.\", 'A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore\\'s character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was \\'fluff\\', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . \\'We\\'re looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,\\' without using drugs, she said. \\'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?\\' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer\\'s disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: \\'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. \\'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.\\' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care \\'neighbourhoods\\'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is \\'very positive\\'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is \\'both innovative and thoughtful\\'. \\'You\\'ve got a group of people with dementia who don\\'t really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,\\' he said. \\'Consequently they\\'re alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.\\' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, \\'Kiss, kiss, I love you\\' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: \\'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?\\' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: \\'Kiss, kiss, I love you.\\' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: \\'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".\\' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. \\'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there\\'s not a lot I can do for her.\\' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: \\'I love you, mum.\\' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: \\'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it\\'s best to start off on the sunny side of the street.\\'', \"An Arizona man who suffers from an extreme case of a tumor disorder in which his body is covered in noncancerous lumps said he finally has a feeling of belonging. Bob Heslip, 50, suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, which is caused by a gene malfunction that causes the bubble-like bumps to appear all over his body. However, he says he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life now that he has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow  where he has met performers including a bearded lady and America's smallest couple. 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Bob Heslip (pictured), 50, who suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow and said for the first time in his life he feels comfortable in his skin . The noncancerous lumps began appearing on his body around puberty and became more severe as he aged . Heslip, who works at a Dollar Tree in Tuscon, said around eight months ago he was on vacation with his family in Los Angeles when they saw the Freakshow, as his daughter is a fan of the TV show. Todd Ray, the owner, saw Heslip and recognized his condition as NF-1 and began talking to him. 'I went to the front, took off my shirt and the crowd went crazy,' Heslip told the Huffington Post. He accepted Ray's offer to join the show as the 'Bubble Boy' a few weeks ago and said it gives him the platform to talk about his condition to people who otherwise just stare. For Heslip, the tumors on his body began appearing around puberty but became more severe as he aged. He noted that when he got married 25 years ago he did not have any bumps on his face, but now he does. 'I don't feel a lot of pain from the bumps,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. 'I have a large bump on the side of my body that used to be very sensitive, but not so much now.' To have the tumors surgically removed is not an option for him as he said it is not guaranteed that they will not grow back or possibly grow back larger than before. Heslip said: 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home' Staying in hiding from the public is also not an option as he has a family including his wife and children to support. Ray said that some people will see Heslip's hands and will not want him to touch their items while he is working because they think he is contagious. As Heslip manages his job in Tuscon and his new role as a performer, he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life because of the Venice Beach Freakshow. The job which he works on the weekends is also making it possible for him to talk to others about NF-1. 'I want to teach people that it's not taboo to ask questions. I'm OK talking about it,' he told the Huffington Post. 'My son and oldest daughter also have this condition and my speaking out about it gets them excited. They know my attitude is positive.' Heslip joins performers including Asia Ray, Morgue, Jessa the Bearded Lady, Larry the Wolf Boy and Miss Sunshine as part of the Venice Beach Freakshow (pictured above) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders affecting around one in every 3,000 people. NF-1 ranges from mild to severe and can cause more symptoms in some people than in others. The condition primarily affects the skin, the nervous system and the eyes, and most people with NF-1 have recognizable signs before the age of 10. The most common symptoms include six or more light brown skin spots (café au lait spots), freckles in unusual places, such as under the arms and in the groin, colored bumps on the iris (Lisch nodules) and Neurofibromas. Regardless if the NF-1 gene change was inherited from a parent or is newly affected, every person who has an NF-1 gene change has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on every time they have a child. Genetic testing for the NF-1 gene is available and can be coordinated for families in which testing would be appropriate.

The unnamed child from Medina, Ohio, gave out $100 notes in the classroom before going to a friend's house after school, where he also showered adults with cash, police said. The group of friends then reportedly went on a shopping spree after the mass giveaway, which began last Wednesday at the town's Claggett Middle School. Payday: The unnamed 13-year-old showered classmates with $100 notes at Claggett Middle School in Medina, Ohio . Medina police told the Akron Beacon Journal\\xa0that the boy, who lives with his 83-year-old grandpa and his mom, swiped the money from the senior's bedside table. Cops began to crack down on the cash bonanza after teachers at the boy's school blew the whistle on the scheme, by which time the majority of the cash was gone. Officers said that, as well as the children themselves, some was spent by 'adults, guardians or associates of the children who received the money', according to the Medina Gazette. Dollar: The children, and adults who were also given money, went on a spending spree. Some $7,000 has been recovered . As of Saturday, police had recovered some $7,000 of the man's savings, as well as some of the items the boy and his friends had bought with it. Police said that prosecutors will file charges once they have determined exactly who was involved. T.J. Hellickson, the school's principal, would only say that the school is co-operating with law enforcement.\", \"The title race appears to be over, but what about the fight to stay in the Premier League? No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It’s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season . Seven points split Sunderland in 15th and Leicester in 20th as the battle for Premier League survival heats up . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Crystal Palace (H) -D . Stoke (A) - D . Southampton (H) - L . Everton (A) - L . Leicester (H) - W . Arsenal (A) - L . Chelsea (A) L . Predicted total: 34 points . Verdict: Safe . Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for. They need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it’s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Aston Villa . Position: 16th on 29 points . Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . Tim Sherwood has helped Villa rediscover their scoring touch since replacing Paul Lambert as manager . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester City (A) - L . Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points . Steve Bruce's Hull  are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining . Ahmed Elmohamady will be a key man in Hull's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Southampton (A) - L . Liverpool (H) - D . Crystal Palace (A) - D . Arsenal (H) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester United (H) - L . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Safe. On goal difference. The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR’s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in . Chris Ramsey may find QPR's goal difference a big disadvantage, particularly with a tough final seven games . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Chelsea (H) - L . West Ham (H) - W . Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City – games you would expect them to lose anywhere – are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull’s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points . Danny Ings will spearhead Burnley's attack as they attempt to escape the Premier League relegation zone . Sean Dyche's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against Hull and Villa . Predicted results: Six points from seven games . Arsenal (H) – L . Everton (A) - D . Leicester (H) – W . West Ham (A) - D . Hull (A) - L . Stoke (H) - D . Aston Villa (A) - L . Predicted total: 32 points . Verdict: Relegated . On paper they probably have the most straightforward opponents, but have the misfortune of playing two of their most critical fixtures – against Hull and Villa – away from Turf Moor. They have won only once away all season so it would be extremely ambitious to expect them to make hay now, considering four of those seven fixtures are on the road. Would expect their status to be decided by the final two games. Leicester . Position: 20th on 22 points . Esteban Cambiasso celebrates after an impressive display helped Leicester beat West Ham 2-1 on Saturday . Nigel Pearson (left) has eight games remaining to get Leicester safe and has five home games to play . Predicted results: Four points from eight games . West Brom (A) - L . Swansea (H) - D . Burnley (A) - L . Chelsea (H) - L . Newcastle (H) - D . Southampton (H) - D . Sunderland (A) - L . QPR (H) - D . Predicted total: 26 points . Verdict: Relegated . As with Burnley, it’s not the most intimidating run-in and they do have the most games from which to gain points. They also have the slight advantage of five fixtures at home. But 22 points from 30 games so far offers little indication that they will mount any kind of sprint for the line.\", \"Bastia president Pierre-Marie Geronimi has called for French League (LFP) president Frederic Thiriez to step down after he did not come down to the pitch to shake the players' hands ahead of Saturday's League Cup final.

Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad\\xa0on Execution Island in Java. The talented artist's birthday is being marked in London where his cousin has organised\\xa0an exhibition of his paintings at the\\xa0Amnesty International headquarters. Meanwhile, the pair are in an isolated cell pinning their hopes on yet another legal quest for mercy which rests with a court that has previously recommended an option of a life sentence for reformed inmates. Myuran Sukumaran has put all of his energy into his art while spending 10 years in Kerobokan jail . His cousin\\xa0Niranjela Karunatilake is currently holding an exhibition of his artwork in London . Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) await their fate on Execution Island in Java - exactly a decade after they were arrested . The pair were identified as leaders of the plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin, taped to the bodies of young mules, on April 17, 2005, and sentenced to death. Since they were refused clemency earlier this year, their lawyers have been desperate to show the courts their rehabilitation over the past decade. Chan is now a pastor and Sukumaran a painter, and both had a hugely positive impact on fellow inmates at Kerobokan jail. Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. His cousin, Niranjela Karunatilake, last visited her cousin on death row in February. Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday'. 'The death penalty is never the answer and I don't believe it deters crime, but in Myu's case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short,' she said. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates.' Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad on Execution Island in Java . Karunatilake said\\xa0his skill has developed over the past four years and she can see him finding himself in his paintings . His cousin Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday' Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives . Their Melbourne barrister Julian McMahon visited the men last week, and says they are well. As he waits for the constitutional court to respond to a new bid to challenge the clemency process, Mr McMahon recalls the court's 2007 recommendation on the death penalty. While it upheld its constitutional validity, the court recommended that death row prisoners who showed rehabilitation after 10 years had the option of being re-sentenced to a fixed term. 'There's absolutely no doubt my two clients have done a heroic job in reforming themselves and many others,' Mr McMahon said. 'I see that as an opportunity to enliven the constitutional court jurisprudence.' President Joko Widodo refused clemency to the men citing a 'drugs emergency' but has the authority to reverse the decision. No date has been fixed for the executions of the Sydney men and eight other drug offenders, but officials say they're considering a date after the Asian African Conference ends on April 24. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates,' Niranjela said . Sukumaran taught inmates how to paint as part of the drug rehabilitation program he set up with Chan . Niranjela said her cousin has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short' “It’s clear painting has been a vital comfort for him on death row,'\\xa0Niranjela said .

Some apparently healthy meals are worse for you than demonised junk foods from the likes of McDonald’s, Burger King and Pizza Express, researchers have found . For example, Asda’s Piri Piri Chicken Pasta Salad contains 46.5g of fat – two thirds of the recommended daily intake for an adult – which is more than the 43.3g found in a Burger King Bacon and Cheese Whopper. Meanwhile a Marks & Spencer Chicken and Smoked Bacon Salad sandwich contains 694 calories and 37.1g of fat – but a Pizza Express Classic Margherita pizza has 683 calories and contains only 22.5g of fat. And a 624-calorie Brie and Bacon Panini from Caffè Nero comes in at more than 100 calories higher than a 518-calorie McDonald’s Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Consumer group Which?, which conducted the research, said it was surprised to find that three of the sandwiches it surveyed contained more than three teaspoons of sugar. These included Pret’s Posh Cheddar and Pickle on Artisan, which contains 17.6g of sugar – equivalent to more than four teaspoons. Which? added it was easy for customers to overeat at lunchtime, with dishes such as Morrisons’ Tomato and Basil Chicken Pasta, which states it contains seven servings, often eaten by one person – meaning they consume 683 calories and 38.6g of fat in one sitting. This is more than Burger King’s Chicken Royale with Cheese, which has 648 calories and 37.2g of fat. Which? said its research proves all food suppliers need to adopt the traffic light labelling system, which flags up levels of calories, fat, sugar and salt, to help consumers cut through the confusion and find healthy lunch options.

'It was dim, the movie was still playing, the alarm was going off,' Aurora police officer Annette Brook told jurors in the trial of gunman James Holmes. 'I began to notice the bodies, the live victims, the blood.' Prosecutors called Brook and two other officers as witnesses on Wednesday, and their descriptions of the chaos of inside the suburban Denver theater intensified the already disturbing scene described a day earlier by moviegoers who were badly wounded or saw loved ones gunned down in the July 20, 2012, attack. Scroll down for video . The third day of the trial against suspected Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes continued on Wednesday. If convicted, Holmes could be sentenced to death. Pictured above in court on Monday, far left . Twelve people were killed and 70 hurt when Holmes allegedly opened fire on a packed theater in Aurora, Colorado for a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises in July 2012. Above, the scene of the theater after the shooting . Twelve people died and 70 were wounded. Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He admits he was the shooter, his defense attorneys say, but schizophrenia had taken control of his mind and compelled him to kill. His lawyers are asking the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, which would send him to the state mental hospital indefinitely. Prosecutors argue Holmes was sane and fully aware that what he was doing was wrong. They want the jury to convict him and sentence him to die. Holmes' defense attorneys want the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors say Holmes knew what he was doing, however. On the left, a sketch of Holmes in court on Monday and and 2012 mugshot on the right . In the opening days of the trial, prosecutors have appeared intent on planting a deeply upsetting image in the jurors' minds. 'It smelled very, very bad,' officer Tomas Campagna testified Wednesday, describing the mixed odors of blood, sweat, urine and feces. 'It's hard to imagine unless you've been there.' Spent cartridges and casings from a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun littered the ground, so thick that officers couldn't avoid stepping on them, Campagna said. In places, the floor looked like it had been painted in blood, he said. Cellphones left behind by the victims rang far into the night. More victims testified Wednesday, describing the booms and the brilliant flashes of light that burst from the muzzles of the weapons aimed at them and the hot pain of being shot. One of those victims was Joshua Nowlan, a former member of the military who worked on aircraft carriers. He went to the movie, 'The Dark Knight Rises,' at the Century 16 multiplex in the Denver suburb of Aurora with friends who had just returned from their honeymoon in Florida. About 15 or 20 minutes into the film, a tear gas canister was thrown into the theater, and then the shooting started. Nowlan, who shielded his friends from the bullets, was shot twice and has undergone multiple surgeries. He used the cane he now needs to walk to show jurors what he saw next. 'I assumed it had to be the shooter, from his stance ... He was walking around, and I can see him pointing the gun in a circular motion that looked like he was searching for more people ... I was terribly scared,' Nowlan told the court. 'My thought process was that he was searching for other people and that he was going to start going row by row, and that anybody he would see in that row who was still moving, he would shoot.' He described the shooter firing three-round bursts. Asked if the gunman moved fast or methodically, Nowlan said: 'He was definitely moving slowly.' None of the victims said they saw Holmes' face, but one of the police officers did. Sgt. Spc. Gerald Jonsgaard testified he saw Holmes lying on the ground in the parking lot outside the theater as two officers arrested him. Jonsgaard didn't identify Holmes by name Wednesday but said he was sitting at the defense table. Holmes' lawyers have not cross-examined any prosecution witnesses. They will call their own witnesses after the prosecution rests.\", \"Joke: Hayleigh Mcbay, of Elgin in Moray, Scotland, pretended to dump her boyfriend\\xa0David Clarke .

Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: \\'£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket\\' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, some of the highest prices in the Premier League . Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: \\'£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket\\'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal\\'s Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool\\'s\\xa0Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices \\'extortionate\\'. \\'In the pursuit of money football has sold it\\'s soul,\\' he said. \\'The fans are that soul and no one cares about the match going fans. Arsenal and Liverpool fans unite outside the Emirates Stadium in a protest against ticket prices . Fans show off a banner reading \\'FOOTBALL WITHOUT FANS IS NOTHING\\' outside the stadium before kick-off . \\'We put up with late fixture changes, unreasonable kick off times and ridiculously high prices. We do it \\'cos of the love of our team. \\'But the tide is turning. Old rivalries are being put aside as fans from all clubs come together. Away fans help make the event but have to pay extortionate prices. Then we\\'re told to \"sit down, shut up\".\\' Roy Bentham of Spirit of Shankly said: \\'We want tangible reductions in line with what working class people earn. We may lose a generation or more of fans otherwise unless the footballing authorities wake up.\\' Further protests are expected after full-time at the Emirates.', \"When she was 15 weeks pregnant with her fifth child, Clare Van Santen was told she had breast cancer. 'I was pregnant with Elijah when I found out that I had breast cancer, so it was a bit scary wondering what was going to happen with the pregnancy and the other kids,' Ms Van Santen told Daily Mail Australia. After undergoing a specific chemotherapy regime which had been found to have no negative impact on unborn children, and having a mastectomy, her son was born happy and most importantly, healthy. 'He had a full head of hair when he was born, and I was bald so that made me feel better,' Ms Van Santen, who is from Perth, joked. Singe mother-of-five Clare Van Santen, 37, (back of image) is currently battling terminal breast cancer. She is pictured here with her four youngest kids\\xa0Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, . The Perth woman was first diagnosed when she was pregnant with her fifth child, Elijah, now aged nine . When she asked her doctor after all her treatment whether she was in remission, he told her that with breast cancer, if it is contained within the breast like hers was, you are essentially cured. But ten years on, after living a life which she thought was cancer-free, the single mum-of-five has been told her cancer is now terminal. Her biggest concern going forward is for her children, whose ages range from 20 to nine years old, and how they will live without her. 'I worry about how they’re going to be and who’s going to look after them, what’s going to happen, how they’re going to cope,' Ms Van Santen said. After her initial diagnosis, the Perth woman learned in October 2013 her cancer had spread to her liver, and she also had a small amount in one of her shoulders. 'I went to have lap-band surgery and they did a scan of my liver and found some legions which ended up being cancer, little tiny bit in my shoulder too,' Ms Van Santen revealed. Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she wants to do with her children: Keisha, 20, Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, in the time she has left . She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, but it has since spread to her liver, shoulder, and brain . The 37-year-old has undergone coutnless chemotherapy and radiation treatments in the past decade . Instead of the surgery she was supposed to have, she had to endure five months of chemotherapy and hormone treatments, which successfully shrunk the spots in her liver. 'For most people a Bucket List is something that has lots of adventurous things on it...\\xa0My Bucket List is for me and my kids, so they can enjoy their home environment and that we can make as many happy memories as possible while I can.' - Clare Van Santen. Some of the items on the mother-of-five's list include: . Then at the beginning of this year, Ms Van Santen began having some strange symptoms once again. 'I'd been having headaches and just forgetting things, and sometimes I'd read something and the worlds had been jumbled around. 'On\\xa0February 14 I had a seizure and discovered the cancer had gone to my brain,' she revealed, saying the horrible event happened in front of three of her kids. Radiation therapy is currently trying to shrink the ten tumors spread throughout her brain, but the cancer is inoperable, and devastatingly, terminal. As for how much time Ms Van Santen has left with her children, it's impossible to know. 'They can’t say,' she said, speaking of her doctors. 'They've said a few months to a few years.' Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she hopes to do, see and experience with her family before her time is up, but life is much harder for her than it used to be. With the time she has left she hopes to makeover the kids' rooms so they have their own sanctuary, get a 'HUGE comfortable leather lounge for me and kids to sit on, so I can be with them', and fix up other things around the house. Ms Van Santen also wants to go on a family holiday on a cruise, have a photo-shoot with her kids, and simply 'make lots of little moments special'. She has thrown her support behind Breast Cancer Care's Buying Time campaign which aims to raise money to fund more breast cancer nurses . Ms Van Santen, pictured here with eldest daughter Keisha, is not sure how much time she has left with her kids . And perhaps the most important: 'Finding someone who will love my kids nearly as much as I do!'. But the medication she currently on makes her more exhausted than 'I've ever been in my life', and leaves her wiped out for days at a time. However the mum-of-five said her life would be even more difficult if she didn't have the support of Breast Cancer Care, WA. She has thrown her support behind the Buying Time Campaign, which aims to raise money which will go towards funding more breast cancer nurses and support services. 'I've rung them crying so many times,' Ms Van Santen revealed. 'Their\\xa0support is so, so amazing.' When a patient first receives their diagnosis and calls the care centre, they are allocated a nurse who helps them through their entire journey. The nurses make house calls, ring and check up on them, send counsellors out to get people through tough times and help patients get connected with support groups. She hopes to take her family on a holiday together, and get a photoshoot with everyone soon . Ms Van Santen also hopes to raise awareness about the mortality rates of women with breast cancer . 'They help with everything, if you need some financial help, or you need legal help, if you need a lift...' Ms Van Santen said. '(And) it’s good to be able to speak to other people going through the same thing,' she added, speaking of the help she received through her Stage 4 support group. Through her involvement in this campaign, Ms Van Santen also wants to help raise awareness about the mortality rates of women who suffer from breast cancer. She has questioned why she is classified as a 'survivor' because she has lived for more than five years after her diagnosis, but will still eventually succumb to the disease. Ms Van Santen said she would like to see more research done on Stage 4, or terminal, breast cancer because even though hers was detected early, it will still eventually take her life. 'So much money goes into awareness for breast cancer, but no money goes into actually researching Stage 4 cancer,' she said, adding that as it's the one that takes lives there should be more known about it. Ms Van Santen hopes in the future there can be more awareness about the mortality rates of the disease, and that people know that even if detected early, that breast cancer can still kill. 'It’s important for so many people, you know, my kids, people's families', she said. You can support the Buying Time campaign here, donate to help Clare Van Santen tick things off her bucket list here, or keep up with her journey here.\", \"Watford dramatically clinched promotion to the Premier League on Saturday on a typically manic afternoon in the Championship - and insist they're well-equipped to stay in the top flight. Slavisa Jokanovic's men beat Brighton 2-0 at the Amex Stadium in the early kick-off and were hoping that Middlesbrough lost plus Norwich failing to win.

Defender Tommie Hoban has called the club's promotion an 'unbelievable achievement' Watford had won at Brighton and were travelling back home on the team coach when news filtered through on that they had won promotion three hours afterwards. Players and staff erupted on the bus when Ross McCormack scored a 94th-minute winner for Fulham at Craven Cottage. The squad uploaded numerous videos on the internet in the immediate aftermath, with Tommie Hoban labelling it an 'unbelievable achievement'. 'For Middlesbrough to lose like this - it's a magical division. There is no other league like it,' Hoban said. 'Luckily we'd just got into the training ground as Rotherham scored. It is the best day ever, it hasn't sunk in yet. 'I think we can definitely stay up - we have a stronger squad than a few of those teams in the Premier League and will add in the summer.'

Denver police report nine arrests in Wednesday\\'s demonstrations.  The charges include assault of a police officer, robbery, resisting police, disobedience to lawful orders, obstructing roadways, and interference. [Previous story, posted at 10:54 p.m. ET] . (CNN) -- In cities across the United States, marchers took to the streets to show support for protesters in Baltimore and to complain about police violence in their own towns. On Wednesday night, several hundred people streamed into Union Square for an \"NYC Rise Up & Shut It Down With Baltimore\" rally. Protesters headed west on 17th Street and were met by New York City Police officers who pushed them back. A small scuffle broke out between the two front lines and police placed at least 20 people in zip ties in the street. The NYPD also handed out fliers and used loudspeakers to tell protesters and pedestrians to stay on the sidewalk. One person was placed in ambulance and taken away. The crowd headed toward Times Square. A law enforcement source told CNN that more than 60 people were arrested during the demonstrations. The rally was organized through social media, much like protests over the killing of Eric Garner, who died while police held him in what appeared to be a chokehold. The demonstrators chanted \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Justice for Freddie Gray\" -- the Baltimore man whose death sparked street confrontations in Baltimore. CNN affiliate WCBS reported Mayor Bill de Blasio sent a message to the protesters: \"I\\'d say that if you want to make change, keep things peaceful.\" A smaller rally was held Tuesday in New York. In Washington, about 500 protesters, mostly in their 20s, gathered in the middle of H Street and 7th and chanted, \"All night, all day, we\\'re gonna fight for Freddie Gray.\" The mood seemed more festive than confrontational, with songs by Public Enemy like \"Fight the Power\" playing and sign-language interpreters translating the music and chants. The protest moved to the White House where most of the crowd dispersed. It started after most office workers had headed home and didn\\'t disrupt the Washington workforce badly. One of the groups involved in the protest is the DC Ferguson Movement. Organizer Eugene Puryear said the march was called to show solidarity with the residents in Baltimore and to highlight that police brutality is a national issue. Several hundred people gathered in Gold Medal Park in Minneapolis for a rally organized by the group of #BlackLivesMatter. The Minneapolis group  held similar events in the past in response to alleged police brutality across the country. Protests also were held in Boston and Houston. On Tuesday, violent protests took place in Ferguson, Missouri, where three people were shot, the city police reported. Police said they didn\\'t do the shooting. A 20-year-old man was arrested and the three victims were in stable condition -- two with wounds to the neck, one in the leg, police said. Police said about 300 people marched, with protesters throwing rocks at police, damaging four police cars and setting trash and debris on fire near Northwinds Estates and West Florissant, police said. One business in Dellwood was damaged, police said. No officers were injured as police conducted anti-riot activities until 3 a.m. In Los Angeles, six people protesting against police brutality were arrested Monday night when they failed to disperse, reported CNN affiliate KABC. About 50 people marched, KABC said. On Tuesday, protesters gathered outside the Stapes Center, where the Los Angeles Clippers and the San Antonio Spurs were playing an NBA playoff game. They disrupted traffic and carried protest signs. In Chicago, hundreds of protesters marched Tuesday from police headquarters at 35th and Michigan through the Southside, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Police made one arrest, for reckless conduct. WGN said protesters spoke about police violence and the death of Rekia Boyd, who was killed by an off-duty officer in 2012. That officer was acquitted last week. The group plans to gather Wednesday night at the DePaul Law School. About 100 people marched Monday night in Oakland in support of Baltimore protesters, reported CNN affiliate KABC. A protest is planned for Thursday in Cincinnati, reported CNN affiliate WXIX.

And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York\\'s John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat\\'s plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat\\'s carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat\\'s carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. \"For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick,\" Stewart said.  \"You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens.\" A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is \"extremely rare.\"  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired \"third-party specialists\" to help in the hunt for Felix. \"We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search,\" Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. \"We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.\" Stewart and her husband booked the cat\\'s flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. \"You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they\\'re treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage,\" Stewart said. It isn\\'t the first time a pet has gone missing at New York\\'s busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix\\'s scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix\\'s safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. \"We just want to find Felix. But I just don\\'t know if we will,\" she said.', \"A senior aide to US Senator Kelly Ayotte has resigned after he was arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute, the senator's office said.

Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England’s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy’s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month . Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st . ‘It’s a concern because I don’t like someone coming in with something you can’t diagnose,’ said O’Shea, Quins’ director of rugby. ‘Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, “It’s six to 12 weeks out”. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we don’t have a timescale. There’s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. ‘You want to see the gladiatorial side of things — the big hits that we’ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we’re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we’re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.’ Brown will have played just six of his club’s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O’Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps . ‘You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,’ said O’Shea. ‘Against Italy it was as big a hit as I’ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. ‘Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.’\", \"Arsene Wenger has revealed he only makes the final decision on his starting line-up on the morning of the match - and agonises over the selection all week. The Arsenal manager, who has taken charge of 1,056 matches since his appointment in September 1996, has lifted the lid on his pre-match rituals in an interview with the official Arsenal Magazine. Wenger said: 'I always have eight or nine players of my team in my head the day before the game, but there's always a doubt on one or two. Arsene Wenger has revealed the selection process he uses to pick his Arsenal team . Wenger lifts the FA Cup following Arsenal's triumph over Hull City at Wembley last season . 'You try to make it as scientific as much as you can, but it's intuitive as well because you have to think if the balance of the team is right or if one player was a bit better in the last training session. 'When two players are together in your mind, competing for one position, every single detail can go for one of them - experience, confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference. 'I always have a final chat with the medical people to make my mind up and make sure that everybody is alright. I do that on the morning of every game. Then I make my decision.' But even though the Frenchman waits until the hours before the game to confirm his team, the overall selection process takes much longer. Wenger, drenched in champagne, is held aloft by his players after Arsenal's FA Cup win last season . Wenger said: 'Anyway, you always have your team in your head, for the whole week. You never go to bed without thinking about what the next line-up will be. 'You live with that always. That can create uncertainties, because you think about it every day. 'If you don't know on Friday night, you will not know on Saturday morning so you have to decide in your head early, and go for it.' Wenger's methods have delivered three Premier League titles and five FA Cups during his tenure at Arsenal.\", \"Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless.

Pacman limbers up ahead of his workout on Monday in the gym just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood . Pacquiao is going through his final preparations ahead of the bout billed as 'The Biggest Fight in History' Confident Pacquiao kicks his feet high during his warm-up ahead of training at Wild Card Boxing . There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight.\\xa0Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout.\\xa0'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'\", \"As inexperienced first-time parents we shower our baby with gifts and document their every milestone. But second children are left to rely on hand-me-downs, with around £500 less spent on them in their first year of life. More than a third of mothers clothed their second baby in one or more hand-me-downs, with 46 per cent giving them toys bought for their elder sibling. Second children are left with hand-me-downs, and around £500 less spent on them in their first year of life . And though 82 per cent have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair or a video of their first steps, only 23 per cent have a keepsake for their second, a report by Debenhams found. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows. Doubtless the latest addition to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's family, due next week, won't have to put up with many hand-me-downs, but he, or she, will be a baby that bucks the trend, says the new study. The report for the high street retailer found on average the second born has over £500 less spent on them in the first 12 months, than the first sibling who is showered with attention and given the best of everything. Second children have to put up with having fewer new clothes bought for then as well as having a poorer record of their upbringing, with noticeably fewer photos and home movies taken of their young life. It happened with Prince William and Prince Harry as babies. The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother. Prince Willam and Prince Harry:\\xa0The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother . Over eight out of ten mums (82%) say they have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair, a video of the first step, or the first drawing while less than one in four (23%) have a keepsake of their second. A third (32%) of second time mums admit to clothing their new baby in one or more hand-me-downs and almost half (46%) say they give them toys which had been brought originally for the elder brother or sister. Mums confess to wasting money on the first born due to, 'inexperience', and the, 'excitement' of a first baby, but also report a sharp decline in gifts for the second- born. They also say they are more knowledgeable about toddlers' demands when it comes to subsequent children and realise they don't need so much. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows . Four of five mums say they bought, or were given, more expensive items than were required when their first child came along. Designer outfits promoted by fashion loving celebrities were rated as the biggest luxury with only 12% of second children being bought clothing with a designer label compared with 38% of first-borns. More than half of first-time mums also admitted to splashing out on clothes their children have never worn. First children have on average 14 cuddly toys by the age of six months, whereas the later child makes do with an average of eight. Mums said they asked friends and relatives for specific practical gifts for the second child rather than relying on chance, which cut down on presents that were never used. When asked about family albums of their children up to the age of two, three quarters admit that those photos almost always include the older sibling. It was only when a toddler started nursery school that the second child started having more photos taken. Debenhams head of childrenswear, Shani Delargy said: 'Having a baby at any time is a momentous experience but it's understandable that mums adopt a much more practical approach by the time the second child comes along. 'Whilst mothers want the best for all their children. It's all about being sensible and looking for good value products. At Debenhams we recognise this and offer a great choice of baby products and clothing for all budgets, including designer labels at high street prices.' According to the Office for National Statistics the average age to have a second child is 30.1 years, while the average age of first time mothers is 28.1 years old. The Duchess of Cambridge was 31 when Prince George was born and is now aged 33. And though 82 per cent have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair or a video of their first steps, only 23 per cent have a keepsake for their second, a report by Debenhams found .\", \"Manchester United and Chelsea will be taking part in the International Champions Cup in the US this summer.

A tense, heartbreaking story, and then a surprise twist at the end. As eight of Mary Jane Veloso\\'s fellow death row inmates -- mostly foreigners, like her -- were put to death by firing squad early Wednesday in a wooded grove on the Indonesian island of Nusa Kambangan, the Filipina maid and mother of two was spared, at least for now. Her family was returning from what they thought was their final visit to the prison on so-called \"execution island\" when a Philippine TV crew flagged their bus down to tell them of the decision to postpone her execution. Her ecstatic mother, Celia Veloso, told CNN: \"We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us.\" Supporters were \"overjoyed\" with the news. \"This is all because of the efforts of the Filipino people and the international community who have been with Mary Jane, her family and the Filipino people all throughout,\" a supporter said upon hearing of the eleventh-hour reprieve. Veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from Malaysia to Indonesia when $500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage. Supporters, including the Filipino advocacy group Migrante, and her lawyers claim the young mother was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn\\'t aware the bag she\\'d been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. The Philippine Embassy in Indonesia\\'s capital, Jakarta, said Wednesday that it welcomed the reprieve and appreciated that the Indonesian government appeared to be reconsidering the case. \"While Mary Jane was convicted for a drug-related offense in 2010, the Philippines believes that due to her personal circumstances, she herself is a victim of heartless drug syndicates,\" embassy political secretary Jed Llona said. \"The alleged recruiters of Mary Jane are currently being investigated in the Philippines, and the embassy hopes that through this ongoing case, those truly responsible for drug trafficking in the region are brought to justice.\" Questions about her detention and trial, including the competency of her translator, have also been raised. Veloso had been given the customary 72 hours\\' notice of execution, and her family had traveled to Nusa Kambangan to say their final goodbyes. However, developments in her home country appear to have changed  -- or at least delayed -- her fate. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso\\'s alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, and her partner Julius Lacanilao surrendered to authorities in the Philippines Tuesday. Sergio faces charges of illegal recruitment, human trafficking, and fraud, but maintains her innocence. Sergio said that she had received anonymous death threats by phone, and further threatening messages from Veloso\\'s family on social media. Veloso\\'s lawyer, Edre Olalia, confirmed that developments in the case had prompted the stay. \"As far as Mary Jane is concerned, her life has been spared for the moment and the reason is that the legal proceedings in the Philippines must be respected first in view of the fact that the illegal recruiter is now in custody,\" he told CNN Philippines. Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters Wednesday that the decision was the result of the Indonesian government\\'s desire to cooperate with the ongoing case in the Philippines. \"There was a letter from the Philippine government saying that there is a legal process related to human trafficking there. So we need to respect this legal process.\" He stressed, however, that the execution was delayed, rather than canceled. Veloso\\'s case has touched the public in her native Philippines, with the highest levels of government and celebrity calling for mercy. President Benigno Aquino met his Indonesian counterpart on the sidelines at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur last weekend and pressed for him to commute Veloso\\'s sentence. Filipino boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, who is primed to fight longtime foe Floyd Mayweather Saturday, made a televised appeal to President Widodo, also asking for mercy for Veloso. \"I am begging and knocking on your kind heart that Your Excellency will grant executive clemency to her,\" he said. Veloso\\'s sons, Mark Daniel and Mark Darren, ages 6 and 12, issued a heartbreaking plea, aimed at Widodo\\'s son, asking him to intervene. \"Please tell your father not to execute her,\" they asked. Ordinary people are also fighting for their compatriot, including Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong, who protested at the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong Tuesday. Philippine Embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. Lawyers fighting to delay her execution previously said they\\'d given up their bid after her second legal review was rejected on Monday.', \"Incredible footage of a Sydney train station flooding during the storm of a decade on Wednesday has been captured on CCTV.

The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an \"Islamic state,\" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt\\'s official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy.

Auckland coastguards have had the shock of their life after receiving an alert that about 5 homemade 'boats' were taking part in an annual fishing event on Sunday. The attendees included a couch strapped to a stack of tyres and a floating Subaru car. Scroll down for video . Auckland coastguards received unusual call out to a homemade boat race that saw aSubaru take to the water . The race also saw a couch strapped to a few tyres and being pulled along by a dingy . Coastguards took to the water near Gulf Harbour, off Auckland's Whangaparaoa Peninsula after receiving a call out about the event from a member of the public. One vessel capsized just outside of the harbour, causing three people to have a bit of a paddle, however no one was injured. The voluntary rescue unit, Hibiscus Rescue and North Shore Rescue lent a hand to the fishermen as alcohol appeared to be involved during the event. Coastguard Hibiscus took to their Facebook to post their surprise at the unique vessels. 'These guys and gals were having a great time today!' they wrote. 'It was great to see everyone wearing lifejackets! Not sure who won the fishing comp?' A video was also released by the coastguard showing two men on a dodgy dingy being transported back to the shore.

One vessel capsized outside of the harbour, however besides getting a bit wet, no one was injured . The men can be heard yelling 'safety first, safety first,' before throwing was appears to be a beer can at another vessel. According to the New Zealand Herald, the event has been happening for years and is aimed to spread positivity through the community. An attendee who asked not to be named said that safety was always paramount and the strong winds at Army Bay were monitored. 'It's all about people building boats. These guys have spent a year restoring boats and we've had a lot of positive feedback from the community. It's 100 per cent positive,' he said. 'We're just locals, just mates, having a good time.'

            "Data: [\"Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature on record, according to meteorologists. Sensors at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 17.5°C (63.5°F). According to meteorologists this is potentially a new record for the warmest temperature measured on the frozen continent. The new temperature record was measured on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (pictured) where the ice shelf covering the sea has declined considerably in recent years and glaciers are thought to be receding . Over a two day period last week temperatures reached 17.4°C (63.3°F) and 17.5°C (63.5°F). However, the heatwave on the coldest continent on Earth has still to be officially certified by the World Meteorological Organisation. Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically. This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Satellite data from 1994 to . 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels, . scientists say. The findings come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of . global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. The previous hottest temperature recorded in Antarctica - which is usually the coldest place on Earth - was in April 24 1961 when the temperature reached 17.1°C (62.8°F). Writing for website Weather Underground, meteorologist Dr Jeff Masters said: 'A new all-time temperature record for an entire continent is a rare event. 'This week's record temperatures were made possible by an unusually extreme jet stream contortion that brought a strong ridge of high pressure over the Antarctic Peninsula, allowing warm air from South America to push southwards over Antarctica. 'At the surface, west to east blowing winds over the Antarctic Peninsula rose up over the 1,000-foot high mountains just to the west of Esperanza Base, then descended and warmed via adiabatic compression (without transfer of heat) into a warm foehn wind (a warm dry wind that blows down a slope).' Antarctica is known as the coldest place on Earth where temperatures have dropped to -93.2°C (-135.8°F) on the East Antarctic Plateau. The graphic above shows rates of thickness change around the Antarctic coastline with areas of most loss in the past 18 years indicated by red circles and areas where ice has increased shown by blue circles . However, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming spots on Earth. While most of the continent has experienced an increase in ice sheet mass, nearly 10,000 square miles of ice has been lost from the ice shelves off coast of the Peninsula. Glaciers extending out from the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula have also been retreating, according to researchers. Climate scientists have blamed the changes happening there on human-generated global warming. The collapse of the Larson B shelf (shown above) on the Antarctic Peninsula is one example of the changes that have been taking place on the continent in recent years and have caused concern among some scientists . Marine sediment cores suggest the changes happening in the area are unprecedented at least in the past 10,000 years. Dr Masters said last week's heatwave matched a trend occurring around the world. He said that in 2015 five nations or territories have now set all time records or matched their records for hottest temperatures in history. He added that 46 nations or territories, out of 235, have set or tied all time heat records since 2010. However, despite the new record temperature, climate scientists are urging caution about drawing conclusions from it. This graphic shows how warm water from the ocean may be increasing the flow of glaciers from the Antarctic ice sheet as they cause melting from below while fresh snow accumulates on top of the ice sheet . Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist with Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, told National Geographic that last year Antarctica also logged a record cold temperature. He said that long term climate changes in Antarctica are complex and still have not been complained properly. The new record will also depend on what scientists regard as being Antarctica. Currently the World Meteorological Society records the warmest temperature on the continent as being at Vanda Station on the opposite side Antarctica on 1 May 1974 when temperatures reached\\xa015°C (59°F).\", \"The Old Bailey was told that Kazi Islam, 18, sent texts to Harry Thomas, 19, who had learning difficulties, persuading him to buy parts for a bomb . A teenager bullied and groomed a friend with learning difficulties into helping him make a pipe bomb in a series of coded text messages which were given away when the friend failed to grasp that 'cake' was a codeword for 'bomb', a court has heard. Kazi Islam, 18, sent messages via his Blackberry to Harry Thomas, 19, praising Lee Rigby's killers and encouraging him to buy a knife to attack soldiers with, along with the ingredients to make an explosive device, the Old Bailey was told. Islam, who is accused of preparing for acts of terrorism, used  'cake' as code for bomb in his messages, but failing to understand his ingenious ruse, Thomas replied: 'Cake? U mean the b o m b', the jury was told. The court heard that Islam, from Manor Park, east London, met Mr Thomas at Barking and Dagenham College in October 2013, and immediately began manipulating him. Messages taken from Islam's phone show that Mr Thomas had confided in Islam about a break-up with his girlfriend, and Islam lied to him about suffering a break-up of his own, saying: ‘Coming back to Islam helped me.’ Prosecutor Annabel Darlow QC said Islam then used his friend to help assemble parts for a pipe bomb, including fireworks, hydrogen peroxide, pipes, metal end caps and glue. She said: ‘The defendant carefully groomed Mr Thomas over many months, flattering him when he appeared willing to do his bidding and bullying him with implied threats of what people associated with him would do if he didn’t carry out his wishes when he didn’t appear to be going according to plan. ‘During the same time period, Kazi Islam carried out research on the internet for information which could assist him in the construction of an explosive device. ‘He also applied liberal encouragement to Thomas to murder a British soldier, inciting him with stories about the murder of innocent children by the military forces and referring approvingly to the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich.’ Ms Darlow said Islam’s messages on WhatsApp and BlackBerry messenger show he was trying to radicalise others at the same time. She added: ‘His activities centred upon two particular planned acts of terrorism. The first of those was a plot to construct an improvised explosive device. The pair met while at Barking and Dagenham College (pictured) in October 2013 after Mr Thomas confided in Islam about breaking up with his girlfriend. Islam then began bullying and grooming Mr Thomas . ‘He also entered into discussions about a second scheme of his, that was to murder a member of the armed forces, although the evidence would seem to show us that the first plot had reached a far more advanced stage than the second. ‘In respect of both enterprises, he sought to use a vulnerable and impressionable young man with mental health difficulties.’ Shortly after the pair met in October 2013, they began talking about buying 'ingredients' for their bomb, with Mr Thomas telling Islam where to find steel and brass caps, the Old Bailey heard. In messages on November 1, Islam admonishes his friend for buying ten inch pipes instead of five inch ones, the jury was told. In a text message Islam then adds: ‘What you need to do is get me the fireworks mate. Ones dat have flash powder in them. The explosions gonna make a big noise.’ Four days later Islam sends Mr Thomas a picture, and Mr Thomas replies asking: 'Is that what we're going to make?' While the image was not shown in court, Ms Darlow said it could be inferred from the response. She added: ‘As the messages between Mr Thomas and the defendant expose all too clearly, Mr Thomas was a vulnerable, not particularly bright young man who was desperate to impress Islam and to try and forge some sort of friendship with him. The court heard that Islam tried to use 'cake' as a codeword for the bomb, but not understanding Mr Thomas replied, saying: 'Cake? U mean the b o m b' ‘Islam exploited to the utmost his friend’s vulnerability and obvious wish to try and ingratiate himself with Islam.’ In December 2013 it appears that Mr Thomas began having second thoughts about the plot, so Islam told him that British soldiers had murdered an innocent 10-year-old boy, the court heard. Mr Thomas then asked Islam if a report in a newspaper saying one of Lee Rigby’s killers had raped a teenager was true, the jury was told. Islam responded: ‘If you read it in the newspaper it’s lies, the media will do anything to give Muslims a bad name.’ Islam also suggested that Mr Thomas change his first name from Harry to Haroon, saying it sounded better. Later that month Islam began messaging Mr Thomas about killing a soldier with a knife, Ms Darlow told the Old Bailey. In messages shown to the court,\\xa0Islam wrote: ‘David Cameron is sending troops to kill innocent people, his soldiers are committing mass murder. ‘If the war doesn’t stop, there should be another soldier killed.’ Thomas replied: ‘U want me to get one’ and Islam told him ‘yeah’. Islam then asked if Mr Thomas would carry out an attack on a soldier. He replied: ‘I don’t agree with what Cameron is doing. I would kill a soldier because they are scum. They have no right to kill these children.’ Pleased with the reply, Islam told him: ‘Well done Harry. I’m glad you understand mate.. I’m proud of you.’ Around the same time Islam began asking Mr Thomas to buy hydrogen peroxide from a shop in order to make into explosives, the court was told. In February the following year Islam also downloaded issues of Al Qaeda's magazine Inspire to his laptop, along with a guide on how to make semtex, Ms Darlow said. However, messages revealed that around this time Islam discovered that Mr Thomas had been telling other people about the bomb, and began threatening him, it was said. He wrote: 'The brothers are gonna come after me and kill me and they’re gonna kill u as well.' Police raided Islam's home in August and recovered a Lenovo laptop computer where they found the bomb-making guides, along with evidence of searches for extreme preachers and extremist material. Islam also sent Mr Thomas texts praising Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right), Lee Rigby's killers, and asked his friend to get a meat clever to kill a soldier, the Old Bailey heard . The court heard Islam’s phone had been used to look up the Al Qaeda propaganda magazine Inspire and the article ‘44 ways to support Jihad’. Islam had also looked up the name of hate preacher Anjem Choudary, killer Michael Adebolajo, and former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, police said. Ms Darlow said that when Islam was arrested, police also raided Mr Thomas’ home. She added: ‘Nothing was found to suggest Harry Thomas had in fact gone on to purchase any of the items the defendant had asked him to purchase.’ Islam denies engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, contrary to section 5 (1) of the Terrorism Act 2006.

Artist and vigil organiser, Ben Quilty speaks during the Ampuni (Mercy) Vigils in February. He has long led the Mercy campaigns and has now addressed a message to Indonesian President Joko Widodo . The heartbreaking message Ben Quilty wrote, directed at Joko Widodo, during Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's last day on earth . Present Joko Widodo has repeatedly rejected all pleas for clemency for the nine on death row . 'Joko Widodo tonight you will kill two good men, my friends,' Quilty wrote. 'I want you to know that you may take their freedom and their lives, you may rob their fellow inmates of the support and love that both men have offered and provided for so long, you can turn off Myu's imagination but you will never kill the memory of them.' Quilty has pledged to become the 'most outspoken critic of the death penalty for the rest of my life'.

But 10 years on from the sunny April day that saw Camilla Parker-Bowles become the Duchess of Cornwall, things are looking very different for the 67-year-old royal. Indeed, so popular has Camilla become, a recent poll revealed that not only is the Duchess loved by 50 per cent of Britons, 56 per cent credit her with Charles\\' own increasing popularity. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: The Prince of Wales has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since marrying Camilla . Still in love: An intimate photo released today to mark their 10th wedding anniversary . More to the point, she has also become a much-loved member of the Royal Family, adored by her step-sons William and Harry and noticeably close to her mother-in-law, the Queen. That her relationship with the rest of the Firm is so good is due, in no small part, to her \\'charm and charisma\\', both of which got an appreciative mention from her husband during a recent interview with CNN. The natural warmth she displays during public appearances has helped cement her place in the Royal Family, with courtiers impressed by her knack of creating an instant rapport with members of the public. Most recently, she pulled off a tour of the US with aplomb, charming locals with her approachability and winning admiring headlines at home. Her relaxed approach to life was in evidence once again during last month\\'s Cheltenham Festival where, accosted by ex-glamour model Katie Price in the paddock, she posed obligingly for a selfie. A few minutes later, she was seen engrossed in conversation with author Jilly Cooper, who memorably based the caddish Rupert Campbell-Black, the star of the much-loved Rutshire Chronicles, on Camilla\\'s ex-husband Andrew Parker-Bowles.

A salt-of-the-earth countrywoman who, given the opportunity, would happily go make-up free and avoid set-piece events, taking on the very public life of a senior royal hasn\\'t been easy. That she has managed it, apparently without breaking a sweat, hasn\\'t gone unnoticed - not least by Prince Charles himself. \\'You can imagine it is a real, real challenge,’ said the prince in the same CNN interview, adding: \\'But she\\'s, I think, been brilliant in the way she\\'s tackled these things\\xa0. insiders say the transformation is less about careful PR work and more about Camilla herself - in particular, the way she has thrown herself into championing the charities closest to her heart. One of the first to benefit was the National Osteoporosis Society, with whom the Duchess has been involved for more than 19 years. \\'Throughout our association with the Duchess, she has been unwavering in her support,\\' says Chief Executive Claire Severgnini. \\'She is personable, knowledgeable and compassionate.\\' All smiles: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoys a chat with the Duchess of Cambridge during the 2012 Jubilee .

Her interest in osteoporosis comes as no surprise to those who know the Duchess. In 1994, aged 47, she was forced to watch as her \\'beloved Mama\\' Rosalind Shand died, slowly and in agony, as a result of the disease. Indeed, the Camilla\\'s association with the charity pre-dates her marriage, with the Duchess first getting involved while still Mrs Parker-Bowles. Asked to join forces with the charity while at the height of her infamy, biographer Penny Junor writes that she was initially reluctant, fearing she might do more harm than good, before agreeing to get involved. Although her first attempt at fundraising was curtailed by Princess Diana\\'s tragic death, she never stopped supporting the organisation and still gets involved in events. She has also made a name for herself as a champion of women\\'s rights, becoming deeply involved in the UK\\'s rape crisis centres and making a visit to a local women\\'s refuge part of every international tour. While visiting Colombian capital Bogota last November, she cut a sympathetic figure as she chatted to rape victims over a cup of tea at the Memory, Peace and Reconciliation Center.

In Washington last month, the Duchess left Prince Charles to his own devices for a couple of hours while she met detectives working for the District of Colombia\\'s Sexual Assault Response Team. Camilla\\'s increasing confidence has also shown itself in the ensembles she wears, with the frumpy get-ups of old swapped for elegant tailored dresses designed to flatter her still-trim waist. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, she\\'s never far from a delicate cream dress and accessorises nearly everything she wears with one of her trademark five-strand pearl chokers. In the country, she likes tailored tweed suits by Roy Allen, one of her favourite couturiers, cosy coats by Swiss label Moncler and flattering hats by London-based milliner, Lock & Co. But as the Duchess of Cornwall prepares to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary, it is the sea-change in her family life as much as her public image that ought to leave her smiling.

Charm: The Prince spoke glowingly of his wife\\'s \\'charm and charisma\\' in an interview last month . Not only is she close to the Queen, who was once reported as wishing she \\'would just go away\\', Camilla is also adored by Diana\\'s sons William and Harry - as photos of the trio laughing together at the opening ceremony of September\\'s Invictus Games made only too clear. \\'Having initially loathed her, the Queen gets on well with Camilla now,\\' adds the insider. \\'She isn\\'t as close to the Queen as Sophie [Countess of Wessex] is but that is partly because the Queen\\'s relationship with Charles is a bit complicated anyway.\\' What certainly isn\\'t complicated is Camilla\\'s relationship with Charles. Despite such quirks  as maintaining separate country homes, after 10 years, the royal couple are closer - and happier - than ever. Born Camilla Rosemary Shand on the 17th July 1947, the Duchess of Cornwall\\'s 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones. The daughter of Major Bruce Middleton Hope Shand and his wife Rosalind, the Duchess was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Sussex along with her siblings, Annabel and Mark. According to her biographer Giles Brandreth, her upbringing, although not royal, was certainly a grand one. \\'Camilla is often described as having had an \"Enid Blyton sort of Childhood\",\\' he writes. \\'In fact, it was much grander than that. \\'The Shands had position and they had help – help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. \\'They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fête. Enough said.\\' After a stint at a Swiss finishing school, Camilla burst onto the London social scene as a debutante on the 25th March 1965. But it wasn\\'t all fun, with the future Duchess of Cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of London firms to pay for her Belgravia flat, which she shared with Lady Moyra Campbell. In the late 1960s, Camilla met the man who was to become her first husband, cavalry officer Andrew Parker-Bowles, with the couple dating off and on for several years - with Mr Parker-Bowles striking up a relationship with Princess Anne at one point. Camilla, meanwhile, had struck up a relationship with Prince Charles, who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971. When the couple split following an overseas posting for Charles in 1973, Camilla reconciled with Parker-Bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year. Two children followed. Tom in 1974 and Laura in 1978. But it was her continuing relationship with Prince Charles that would come to define her, with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people. In 1992, claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when Diana: Her True Story was published, followed, a year later by the \\'Camillagate\\' scandal. By 1995, both marriages had come to an end and Charles and Camilla were unofficially back together, with the future Duchess often seen attending events with the prince. Royal acceptance soon followed with the Queen making Camilla part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. A year later, the Duchess moved into Clarence House and on the 10th February 2005, Charles and Camilla\\'s engagement was announced. The couple married just under two months later in Windsor, with Camilla taking the title of the Duchess of Cornwall.', \"Blown up in Iraq, Hannah Campbell defied the odds to have a miracle baby after shrapnel damaged her womb. But behind the joy of celebrating daughter Lexi-River’s first birthday, the former Army corporal has battled new agony after twice nearly dying from a mystery illness since the birth. Miss Campbell, 30, was struck down with a condition that caused her stomach to rupture, leaving her fighting for her life in intensive care, and feared she would not be there to help Lexi-River blow out the candles on her cake. Scroll down for video . Hannah Campbell, pictured with her daughters Milly (left) and Lexi-River (right), defied the odds to have a miracle baby after shrapnel damaged her womb from a blast in Basra . And as she struggled to recover, her relationship broke down with long-term partner and Lexi-River’s father Anthony McMorrow, who proposed to her on Valentine’s Day last year. Miss Campbell said: ‘I was just so desperately ill that the relationship was put under extreme pressure.’ But the split was amicable, with Miss Campbell and Mr McMorrow, 32, a marketing consultant, making Lexi-River their priority. Miss Campbell suffered horrific injuries when a mortar bomb hit the building in Basra she was guarding while serving with 19 Tank Transporter Squadron in 2007 as a young mum with a then three-year-old daughter, Milly, from a previous relationship. She has since split from long-term partner\\xa0Anthony McMorrow (left). She was\\xa0serving with 19 Tank Transporter Squadron (right) in 2007 when the blast happened . The couple, pictured with Hannah's daughter Milly and Anthony's son Leo, have decided to split after Hannah began suffering from a mystery condition . She was blinded in one eye, her left hand was split in two and her left leg was shattered. Shrapnel damaged her abdomen, leading doctors to tell her she’d never be able to have another child. Two years after the blast she elected to have her leg amputated, as unbearable pain had left her housebound. During her recovery she gained weight from being wheelchair-bound, going from 9½ st to 21st, while post-traumatic stress disorder caused her to lose her hair. With the help of doctors Miss Campbell, from Northampton, rebuilt herself with a £52,500 makeover including a prosthetic leg, make-up which is tattooed on, Botox, gastric band weight loss treatment, a tummy tuck and hair extensions. She even treated herself to breast enlargements. She underwent a £52,500 makeover after she gained weight from being wheelchair-bound after her leg was amputated following the blast . Although doctors told her she would never conceive again, she gave birth to Lexi-River on March 31 last year. But when Lexi-River was ten days old, Miss Campbell suffered excruciating stomach pain and was rushed to hospital. Miss Campbell was previously married to husband Jamie, father to their daughter Milly . She said: ‘It was like history was repeating itself as I lost so much of Milly’s childhood having operations and recovering after the blast.’ Doctors found she had a perforated ulcer and operated to stem the bleeding. Six months later she developed a larger ulcer, which perforated. She said: ‘I ended up with 40 staples holding my stomach together. I was in hospital all over Christmas and finally got out in early January this year.’ Last weekend she was readmitted with stomach pains, but she was determined not to miss Lexi-River’s birthday on Tuesday and checked herself out 24 hours before, getting home in time to make cupcakes with Milly for the party. Miss Campbell said: ‘Because of everything I’ve been through celebrating Lexi-River’s first birthday is a milestone not only for her, but also for me. In my darkest times I feared I wasn’t going to make it, but I just couldn’t give up because of my two daughters.’ She will spend the next month having tests as doctors explore the possibility she may have a rare condition which is causing her stomach to ulcerate.\", \"Mark Hughes thinks Tom Jones is stopping Stoke City from qualifying for Europe. But on the green, green grass of home, his side were the ones denting hopes of facing the Continent’s elite teams with this 2-1 victory over Ronald Koeman’s Southampton.

However, after Morgan Schneiderlin prodded Southampton into a deserved lead, a second-half turnaround with goals from Mame Diouf and Charlie Adam damaged the visitors hopes of finishing in the top four — and had the Stoke fans belting out their favourite 60s hit. Hughes said: ‘We are not going to get too many Fair Play points today. ‘The key was that we got three Premier League points, though.’ The result had Koeman acknowledging that the Saints’ unlikely march to the top four was over. ‘Sometimes I have to answer questions about Champions League football,’ he said. ‘I don’t like that because the distance to fourth place is five points and now maybe it is eight. We are fighting for a Europa League place — that’s our Champions League. You have to see it like that.’ Mame Biram Diouf is joined by teammate Jon Walters as the Stoke City duo celebrate their equaliser at the Britannia Stadium . Steven Nzonzi is quick to congratulate Diouf on his goal against Champions League chasing Southampton at the Britannia Stadium . French international Morgan Schneiderlin gives Ronald Koeman's Champions League chasing Southampton the lead at the Britannia Stadium . Hughes is entitled to be happy, with his side in ninth spot with five matches to play. Survival in the Premier League, always the priority in these parts, was secured as early as March, leaving the manager, with the ink drying on a four-year contract, to set new targets. He wants Stoke to better last year’s points tally of 50 and secure consecutive top-half finishes in the top flight for the first time in 40 years, and this result leaves such feats on the cards. Victory was unlikely in a one-sided first half. Southampton, who had wasted chances, eventually took one when Jose Fonte rose at the near post to divert Steven Davis’s corner goalwards but was denied by a goal-hanging Schneiderlin, who got the final touch before it crossed the line. Graziano Pelle should have doubled the lead when played in by a lively Sadio Mane but Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic saved well to leave Koeman ruing his side’s profligacy. ‘I think we played very well in the first 45 minutes and were by far better team,’ he said. ‘Maybe we could have been more clinical in the box but in general we played well today, we played at least at our level and it’s important to keep that for rest of the season.’ For all Southampton’s dominance Stoke should have been level when Geoff Cameron flicked on a Marko Arnautovic free-kick only for an unmarked Steven Nzonzi to inexplicably miss from no more than two yards out.

Schneiderlin  celebrates the first goal with his team-mates during the Barclays Premier League match between Stoke City and Southampton . They did go level following the arrival of Adam from the bench, albeit in exceptionally fortunate circumstances. When Nzonzi mis-hit a cross into the sky there were groans. When it landed on the bar and Diouf slammed home the rebound they turned into disbelieving cheers. The first Delilah of the day duly followed, with Adam urged to shoot wherever he picked up the ball. With six minutes remaining he did just that, lashing home following a goalmouth scramble to bring that song out again. ‘I think he played the initial ball into the box, followed his ball in and thankfully it has dropped to him,’ said an admiring Hughes. ‘It’s great technique. He knows exactly what he is doing. He has hit it into the ground and that has made it even harder for the keeper to save it.’ Adam’s fellow substitute Peter Crouch could have piled on the agony for Koeman after being teed up by Jonathan Walters but scuffed his shot wide from six yards. More misery for the Saints arrived in injury time when Toby Alderweireld went down clutching a shoulder and was carried off on a stretcher, although he is expected to be fit for the remainder of the run-in.

Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard. She had attempted to kill herself three months before the tragedy but was unable to receive the treatment recommended to her by doctors. Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard. \\xa0Ms Oettinger had starting suffering depression after going to Zaki's father, Mohammed El Shaer, in Egypt, and discovering he had another family, an inquest heard . Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard. After visiting a psychiatrist in November Zaki was referred to social services, although the case was not reviewed. It meant the family and Zaki's safety was never assessed by the authority. A coroner has today ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures in the months before she and her young son lay in the path of a train in March 2012. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch\\xa0said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths. A coroner has ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths . Ms Lynch concluded at the end of a three-day inquest that Ms Oettinger, who suffered chronic anxiety, unlawfully killed her son. She said: 'Donna Oettinger suffered from depression and had suicidal ideas. 'She had taken a significant overdose and had been seen by a number of professionals. 'The failures that I have identified, are in some respects quite significant, but can't be said to have caused or contributed to her death or Zaki's.' She said some of the measures now in place might have made a difference, but added: 'I think it is unlikely that Donna Oettinger would have been admitted to hospital or prevented from being alone with her child. 'Whether there might have been some improvement in her condition it is impossible to say.' The Coroner identified five separate failures by doctors and nurses at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Croydon child protection services, who first came into contact with Ms Oettinger in late 2012. Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard . Ms Oettinger took an overdose of tablets while visiting a friend in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on December 13 2012. A social worker in Rotherham advised doctors back in Croydon that she should be cared for by a Home Treatment Team (HTT) However the request was not met. After a follow up appointment back in London a few days later no-one liaised with Rotherham and Ms Oettinger was not reassessed. Doctors decided that instead of treating her at home she would benefit from her own 'care coordinator'. But a miscommunication meant this never happened. As a result the Trust failed to check on Ms Oettinger's condition when she missed a number of appointments in early 2013. The pair died around a month after her last missed appointment. Zaki's grandmother, Carol Oettinger, wept as the the Coroner recorded her daughter's death as suicide and the unlawful killing of Zaki. The coroner said: 'With respect to Donna Oettinger the only appropriate conclusion in this case is a matter of law I conclude to be one of suicide.' With respect to Zaki, she said:\\xa0'His mother was suffering from an anxiety disorder. The conclusion for Zaki, again as a matter of law, must be one of unlawful killing.' At the end of the hearing the Coroner pleaded that the horrific nature of Zaki's death and its link to Ms Oettinger's health didn't undo work to end stigma around mental illness. She said: 'It's important to recognise what happened to Donna and Zaki is very much out of the ordinary. '[But] I fear that the stigma of depression and mental illness will grow as a result of events such as these. 'The circumstances of these deaths are extremely upsetting, even for the experienced professionals who dealt with the events of March 22 2013. 'But they represent a tiny fraction of Donna and Zaki's lives. The mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at a south London station, before their deaths . 'Zaki was a happy child who was very much loved by all those around him and wouldn't have had any time at all to understand what happened to him. 'The events that day do not define them as people. 'Don't let anyone tell you that suicide can always be prevented. They are wrong. Zaki and Donna deserve to be remembered as they were in happier and healthier times.' Speaking after the hearing,\\xa0Bridget Hughes, Solicitor to the Oettinger family at Kingsley Napley LLP said: 'The Oettinger family is devastated by the loss of Donna and dear Zaki. No one could have fought harder than Donna's mother, Carol, to try and get the care her daughter desperately needed when she became ill. 'The Coroner has heard that there were serious shortcomings in care at the Croydon Mood Anxiety and Personality Disorder Team (MAP) which was managed by the South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. 'These shortcomings permeated through from community psychiatric nurse to consultant level. The service, fragmented in design, was chaotic in its implementation. 'In the family's view, this contributed to Donna's deepening despair and distress. 'Nothing will bring Donna and Zaki Oettinger back, but it is hoped that something may be learned from this family's experiences given the detailed investigation that has since taken place.'\", \"A family-friendly coffee shop had its Facebook page hacked and flooded with pornography after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email. Staff at Scooter's Coffee, in Omaha, were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours, starting at 5pm on Sunday, by an 'unknown third party' who then took control of the picture feed. Instead of the usual images of smoothies, coffees and cookies, the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked. Scooter's Coffee, Omaha, issued this apology to customers on its Facebook page after it was hijacked by hackers for 24 hours who used it to post pornography . Scooter's said that the images which appeared on their Facebook page were similar to the images that were posted on Crayola's page when they were hacked in January (pictured) From 5pm Sunday until almost the same time the next day, followers of the Scooter's Facebook page were sent links such as this one, instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . After trying to contact officials at Facebook with limited success, it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out, and regain control of the account. Jamie Hamburg, spokesman for the company, said: 'At approximately 5pm CST on Sunday, 29 March, the Scooter's Coffee Facebook page was hacked by an unknown third party. 'The offensive content that has been posted as a result of this hack is similar to that seen in other recent breaches of major brands. 'Scooter's Coffee would like to apologize to our loyal Facebook audience and anyone that has been affected by this inappropriate content.' The hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through Facebook itself. The hacker then kicked the member of staff out of the page, locked it, and began posting. Scooter's Coffee said that, despite repeated attempts to contact Facbook, and hundreds of reports being sent about inappropriate content, nobody at the social media network responded. It was only by contacting larger businesses that they were able to get in touch with Facebook, who removed the content and restored the page nearly 24 hours later. All of the images have now been removed, and Scooter's have offered apologies to thier customers via their Facebook and Twitter pages . It is thought that the hack occurred after an employee clicked on a link in an email which purported to be from Facebook. Hackers were then able to gather enough data to allow them to take control of the page . Crayon manufacturer Crayola was caught out by a similar breach in January, when hackers took control of the page to post pictures of cartoon breasts, and links to adult websites. One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.' Delta Air Lines was also affected the following month in a similar attack\\xa0involving a link to a sexually explicit joke.

Miriam González Durántez is not one to blend into the background. She is known for her bold choices and this exotic look was no exception.

Her bright pink, long-sleeved dress was covered in bright blooms at the LDNY fashion show and WIE (Women: Inspiration and Enterprise) award gala at Goldsmiths' Hall celebrating inspirational women and ethical fashion. As if the flower pattern was not enough of a nod to spring, a yellow and pink corsage was pinned to her shoulder. And despite the spring blossoms across the country, this was one of fake flowers. The outfit was accompanied by a £560 pair of Gianvito Rossi Perspex-panelled metallic patent-leather pumps on her feet and a matching thin belt defining her waist. She was pictured tonight with the likes of model Daisy Lowe, designer Kelly Hoppen and Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry. According to The Daily Telegraph, she told an audience: 'Political advisers prefer us to stick to safer ground like kitchens and children. But I much prefer risky ground to political advisers.' And in an article for the Huffington Post written before tonight's event, Miss González Durántez said: 'No matter your age, your skills or your background, every woman has an inner role model and it is the duty of every woman of my generation to stand up for young girls.'

The image shows a giant distant cluster of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 inside a stellar 'breeding ground' called Gum 29, 20,000 light-years from Earth. In the image massive young stars can be seen feeding a nearby region with the fuel it needs to form new stars. Scroll down for video . A stellar nursery of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 located about 20,000 light-years from the planet earth in the constellation Carina is shown in this image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, released today to celebrate the silver anniversary of Hubble's launch . Hubble was launched on 24 April 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery. Despite a shaky start, when its primary mirror was ground to the wrong shape, Hubble soon began returning fantastic images of the distant universe, to the delight of scientists and the public alike on Earth. And this latest image is no exception, revealing a fascinating cluster of stars in the constellation Carina. The telescope, when it was first devised, was ambitious to say the least - it is 43ft (12.3 metres) long and 14ft (4.2 metres wide). It orbits Earth at a height of about 345 miles (555km) at a speed of 16,000 mph (27,750km/h), with its instruments finely tuned to account for its movement. It is able to image the universe in near-infrared, visible light and ultraviolet. It’s estimated that the telescope can continue operating until 2020, when it will overlap with the James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to launch in 2018. 'Hubble has completely transformed our view of the universe,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of Nasa's Science Mission Directorate. 'This vista of starry fireworks and glowing gas is a fitting image for our celebration of 25 years of amazing Hubble science.' Hubble captured the image using its Wide Field Camera 3, which pierced through the dusty veil of dust and gas around the stellar nursery using near-infrared light. The cluster is between six and 13 light-years across but only two million years old, and thus contains some of the hottest, brightest and most massive stars in the galaxy. Some of the biggest stars in the cluster unleash torrents of ultraviolet light and hurricane-force winds of charged particles that disrupt the surrounding cloud of hydrogen gas. Inside the nebula is a fantasy landscape of pillars, ridges and valleys made of gas - the fuel for new stars. Some of the pillars are several light-years tall and point towards the centre of the cluster, while other dense regions surround the pillars. As the clusters is very young in astronomical terms, it has not had time to disperse its stars into deep space, so it provides astronomers an opportunity to gather information on how clusters like this form. Hubble's near-infrared imaging camera pierces through the dusty veil enshrouding the stellar nursery, giving astronomers a clear view of the dense concentration of stars in the central cluster, shown . Westerlund 2 is surrounded by the star-forming region Gum 29. The heaviest cluster stars are unleashing a torrent of ultraviolet radiation and hurricane-force winds streaming with charged particles, etching away the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud from where the cluster formed . The red dots scattered throughout the landscape around Westerlund 2 are a rich population of newly forming stars still wrapped in their gas-and-dust cocoons. These tiny, faint stars are between 1 million and 2 million years old and have not yet ignited the hydrogen in their cores. Hubble's near-infrared vision allows astronomers to identify these fledgling stars . The pillars in the star-forming region surrounding Westerlund 2, composed of dense gas, are a few light-years tall and point to the central cluster. They are thought to be incubators for new stars. Besides sculpting the gaseous terrain, intense radiation from the most brilliant of the cluster stars is creating a successive generation of baby stars. The bluish haze is an indicator of oxygen gas in the nebula . The image is part of a week of celebrations by Nasa to commemorate what is widely regarded as the most important space telescope of all. 'This is really an exciting week for astronomers and people who love astronomy all over the world,' said Hubble scientist Jennifer Wiseman at a televised anniversary celebration at the Newseum in Washington, DC. Learning about the life cycle of stars was one of the reasons Hubble was built. By operating above distortions and blocking effects of Earth's atmosphere, astronomers hoped to look farther back in time, at generations of stars and galaxies that formed closer to the Big Bang, some 13.7 billion years ago. But the mission almost start in disaster, when Nasa discovered a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's 7.9ft (2.4-meter) diameter mirror. Corrective optics, installed by space-walking astronauts, saved the day in 1993, the first of five servicing calls by Space Shuttle crews. 'We never thought it would last this long,' said Nasa administrator and former astronaut Charlie Bolden, the pilot on the mission that launched Hubble. Nasa is celebrating the Hubble Space Telescope's (pictured) 25th anniversary with a variety of events highlighting its groundbreaking achievements and scientific contributions with activities running April 20-26.  In its quarter-century in orbit, the observatory has transformed our understanding of our solar system and beyond, and helped us find our place among the stars . This is one of Hubble's most iconic images: the Eagle Nebula's Pillars of Creation. It shows the pillars as seen in visible light, capturing the multi-coloured glow of gas clouds, wispy tendrils of dark cosmic dust, and the rust-coloured elephants trunks of the nebulas famous pillars. The dust and gas in the pillars is seared by the intense radiation from young stars and eroded by strong winds . Here we see one of the universe's most stately and photogenic galaxies, the Sombrero galaxy, Messier 104 (M104).  The galaxy's hallmark is a brilliant white, bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy. As seen from Earth, the galaxy is tilted nearly edge-on . This dramatic image offers a peek inside a cavern of roiling dust and gas where thousands of stars are forming. The image, taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard Hubble, represents the sharpest view ever taken of this region, called the Orion Nebula. More than 3,000 stars of various sizes appear in this image. Some of them have never been seen in visible light . Many of the telescope's most important discoveries turned out to be in areas that didn't even exist when it was launched. Hubble's observations of a particular kind of exploded star helped astronomers realise that the pace of the universe's expansion is ramping up, propelled by some unknown force referred to as 'dark energy.' Hubble also has imaged a planet beyond the solar system and scanned other planets' atmospheres for telltale chemical fingerprints. The first so-called exoplanet was discovered in 1992, two years after Hubble's launch. 'Hubble has fundamentally changed our human understanding of our universe,' Bolden said. Nasa hopes to keep Hubble operating through 2020 to overlap with its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in October 2018.\", \"The Queen’s staff will take industrial action for the first time in history over their ‘ridiculously low’ wages. Wardens at Windsor Castle say they are expected to carry out extra duties, including giving guided tours to visitors, for no extra money. Union chiefs claim workers earn as little as £14,700 despite working the ‘country’s richest family’. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) have voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay . Their main role includes meeting and greeting visitors, conducting security searches, telling people about the history of the Castle, and handing out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said staff are also asked to perform extra duties for free, such as leading paid-for tours, carrying out first aid and speaking foreign languages to overseas visitors. Now, staff have voted ‘overwhelmingly’ in favour of industrial action after complaining they have suffered ‘years of pay restraint’. The PCS said 76 wardens out of 180 at the Castle will now refuse to host tours of the Great Kitchen and the Tower and will instead ‘work to rule – meaning they rigidly stick to their contractual obligations. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family (pictured at the Castle) should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' Wardens are also considering causing ‘disruption’ and ‘long queues’ by conducting more thorough security searches than usual and ‘observing every single check they are supposed to do’ – slowing down visitors’ entry to the Castle. The wardens work for the Royal Collection Trust, a charity which presides over one of the world’s largest and most important works of art, jewels and artefacts. It is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation, so they are technically employees of the Royal Household. A spokesman for the PCS said: ‘The dispute here is not with the Queen and the Royal Family but the managers who run the Castle on their behalf. ‘The wardens who work at Windsor Castle are very loyal and want to work for the Royal Family. ‘We believe our requests are modest and reasonable and, by not resolving this dispute, the Royal Collection is dragging the Queen’s name into this. That is not what staff want.’ Staff claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties such as guiding visitors around Windsor Castle\\xa0for no additional money . The union has proposed that wardens receive an extra £150 a year for speaking a foreign language to visitors and an allowance for every day they conduct tours. They claimed that at nearby Hampton Court Palace, owned by a separate charity, wardens received an extra £10 to £15 a day for leading guided tours and that Windsor Castle staff should also receive ‘fair recompense’. The union said they narrowly accepted a poor pay offer last year on the understanding that additional allowances for tours and other skills would be considered this year. But following failed negotiations, non-strike industrial action could now start from the end of April. A Royal Collection Trust spokesman said: ‘Following the union ballot, we have been informed that some PCS-affiliated wardens at Windsor Castle will no longer participate in various activities undertaken during their working day, including using their language and first-aid skills, and conducting tours of specific areas of the castle during August and September. A spokesman for the Royal Collection Trust, which employee the wardens at one of the official residences of the Queen said they were 'disappointed' with the result of the ballot . ‘These activities have never been compulsory. It has always been the choice of the individual as to whether they take part. ‘While the outcome of the ballot is disappointing, it will have no effect on services to visitors to the castle.’ The Royal Collection said that only nine wardens were required to conduct tours every day out of an average of 85 wardens in work, and that the industrial action should have ‘no impact’ on visitors. Asked about the threat of slower security searches, a spokeswoman said: ‘Security searches at Windsor Castle are rigorous and we would expect staff to carry out their usual duties.’ Staff’s wages were raised to the new ‘living wage’, which is above the National minimum wage, earlier this month. This increased wardens’ pay from £7.70 an hour (£14,400 a year) to £7.85 an hour (£14,700). But the PCS complained that the living wage officially rose last November and that this wage hike should therefore be back-dated – a condition the Royal Collection has now agreed to.\", \"Chelsea were made to work hard for their three points against Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but Eden Hazard starred for Jose Mourinho's team. He slotted Chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before Charlie Adam equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time. Stoke continued to make things difficult for Chelsea until an Asmir Begovic error led to Loic Remy tapping in the winner. Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill gives his player ratings. CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Thibaut Courtois – 5.5 . Never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by Adam with an incredible strike from inside Stoke’s half. Too far off his line and one of the world’s best goalkeepers was left embarrassed. Thibaut Courtois was on the winning team but will want to forget  Charlie Adam beating him from his own half . Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry leap up to block an attempt at goal from Stoke's Philipp Wollscheid . Branislav Ivanovic – 6.5 . Tidied up well on the rare occasion Stoke threatened. Played with more freedom once Chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing. Gary Cahill – 6 .5 . Looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as Stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half. John Terry – 7 . Manned the back well and it took a goal-of-the-season contender for his team to concede against a Stoke side that ran out of ideas at times. Always the man that remained at the back to kill off any threat. Cesar Azpilicueta – 6.5 . Tried to get forward and help Hazard down the left. Closed down well and put in a tireless performance. Nemanja Matic – 6 . A few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for Chelsea. Cleaned up well when needed to win back possession, however. Cesc Fabregas – 7 . Won the penalty with a clever cut back that fooled Wollscheid. Kept the midfield ticking over well. Brazil international Willian (left) also produced an impressive display for Chelsea in the win over Stoke . Eden Hazard put Chelsea into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half . Diego Costa's (right) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury . Willian – 7.5 . A handful for Stoke as he, Oscar and Hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half, though they were never taken. Never short of a run. Oscar – 6.5 . Scuppered one of Chelsea’s best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post, and was ultimately – and unfortunately – sacrificed for Costa at half time. Eden Hazard – 8.5 . A live wire. Master of the one-two and creating chances. Ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give Chelsea a much-needed lead before Adam’s equaliser. Didn’t look tired, despite his weariness during international break. Assisted the winning goal. Loic Remy - 7.5 . Looked a worthy replacement for Costa as he twice went close to giving Chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes. Scored in the second half when Mourinho really needed it, and it was deserved. Loic Remy (left) slots in Chelsea's winner against Stoke in the second half at Stamford Bridge . SUBS: . Diego Costa – 6 . Came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury. Immediately called to the bench for him to come off after 10 minutes on the field. Didier Drogba – 6 . Replaced Costa after the striker went off with an injury. Had little to do but hold up the ball. Juan Cuadrado – 6 . Little to do but helped Chelsea get over the line. MANAGER: Jose Mourinho – 6.5 . A frustrating afternoon for Mourinho, who was active on the touchline throughout, looking unhappy and muttering to himself. Either way, it worked, and his team added three points to their title charge. Jose Mourinho was active throughout the game on the touchline as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 . STOKE CITY (4-4-2) Asmir Begovic – 6.5 . Outstanding one-handed save at full stretch to deny Remy’s deflected shot after less than three minutes. Ultimately took a penalty for Begovic to concede the first. He’d done his homework, going the same way Hazard normally does, but beaten at the other side. His throw was intercepted by Willian which led to Chelsea's winner, though. Geoff Cameron – 5.5 . Given the unwanted task of stopping Hazard on his runs down the left wing on occasion. Ryan Shawcross – 6 . Stayed physical throughout, as per. Captained his team well on a ground that has been unkind to them previously, but ultimately could not help them steal a point. Philipp Wollscheid – 5.5 . Took the bait from Fabregas by sweeping the Spaniard’s feet to give Chelsea a penalty and ultimately the lead. Ryan Shawcross (right) led Stoke well but could not help his side take a point at Stamford Bridge . Wollscheid (right) slides in on Cesc Fabregas to concede a penalty in the first half, from which Hazard scored . Marc Wilson – 5.5 . A little unsure at times, largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team-mates. Stephen Ireland – 6 . Strong in midfield but found it difficult to get involved as that area was dominated by the men in blue. Glenn Whelan – 5.5 . Rightly booked for a late challenge on Fabregas but did not see much of the ball as Chelsea dominated midfield. Steven Nzonzi – 6 . Close with a controlled shot after a poor clearance by Matic and again in the second half as he grazed the far post with a bouncing effort across goal. Could not take the few chances that fell his way. Steven Nzonzi (centre) went close to scoring for Stoke but ultimately did not impose himself on the game . Charlie Adam (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores . Charlie Adam – 6.5 . Take a bow, Charlie Adam. Incredible goal as he channelled his inner David Beckham and, noticing Courtois off his line, scored from in his own half. A little anonymous until that moment, but his faults were obliterated with that 66-yard strike. Jonathan Walters – 5.5 . Little joy as Stoke rarely threatened up top but tried to keep them in with a shot and held the ball well on occasion. Closely marked by Terry throughout. Mame Biram Diouf – 5.5 . Failed to make an impact and was substituted after 62 minutes for Arnautovic. Jonathan Walters (left) had little joy for Stoke against Chelsea on Saturday, despite his hard work . Mame Biram Diouf (left) floundered against Chelsea's stern defence at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . SUBS: . Arnautovic – 6 . Too little too late to have an influence. MANAGER: Mark Hughes 5.5 . His team were constantly on the backfoot. REFEREE: Jonathan Moss 6 . Correct decision with the penalty. Not many controversial decisions to make aside from that, but had to be strict with bookings .\", \"A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her . The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test . Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation . Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said: \\xa0'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury. 'That was Daniel James and the £207 was put aside because the head stone was going to cost £500 altogether. 'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him. I feel betrayed, horrible. You try and do a good gesture to people and then you get it thrown in your face.' Tears: She then burst into tears and rushed off the stage - pursued by the Jeremy Kyle cameras . Sobbing: She was comforted by her partner, also called Jamie, after the show .\", \"At least 34 people were arrested after hundreds of protesters gathered in New York City on Tuesday night to march against police brutality.

Dortmund are expecting further departures with Manchester United keen on Mats Hummels and Ilkay Gundogan while Real Madrid have expressed interest once again in Marco Reus. Liverpool are also continuing to check on Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia but their lack of Champions League football could prove crucial in their pursuit of certain players as well as their budget. Arsenal have also considered reviving interest in France international Kondogbia. Arsene Wenger enquired after the 22-year-old while he was at Sevilla. Geoffrey Kondogbia (left) of Monaco is also wanted by Liverpool and Arsenal have a long standing interest . Spartak Moscow want to rescue Nemanja Vidic from his nightmare spell at Inter Milan. The former Manchester United captain, now 33, has failed to settle under Roberto Mancini and has been criticised for some of his performances. Spartak have reportedly offered a one year deal worth around £35,000 a week but Vidic wants two years if he leaves Italy. Vidic played for Spartak between 2004 and 2006. Nemanja Vidic (right) has struggled since moving to Italy with Inter Milan and is attracting interest in Russia . Tottenham sent a scout to watch Lille against Bordeaux last weekend where Lille won 2-0 and midfielders Sofiane Boufal and Idrissa Gueye impressed.

Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka was understood to be the object of Tottenham's attentions with Chelsea and West Ham also represented at the game. Chelsea have checked on Standard Liege left-back Damien Dussaut. The 20-year-old Frenchman has only started five games in the Belgian league this season but is seen as a bright prospect. Paris Saint Germain remain keen on Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with Liverpool looking unlikely to match the financial package required to prise him out of Stamford Bridge. PSG also like Tottenham's Hugo Lloris but Daniel Levy is no mood to sell the France goalkeeper. Damien Dussaut (left) has impressed for Standard Liege despite only starting five games this season . Manchester City are considering the merits of QPR goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. The 25-year-old has had to take a back seat this season while in-form Robert Green held down the No 1 spot. However, the England U21 international is still recognised as one of the more talented English keepers in the country and has been the subject of interest from Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton over the past year. Alex McCarthy (centre) has played second fiddle to Rob Green at QPR but could be a target for Man City . He joined QPR from Reading at the end of last August despite Brendan Rodgers making an attempt to take him to Anfield. City need to address their shortage of homegrown players and McCarthy could fit in. Feyenoord, meanwhile, are struggling to finance a transfer for City striker John Guidetti who has been on loan at Celtic. Stoke City are keen on Blackpool teenager Dom Telford. The 18-year-old striker managed to break into the Blackpool first team this season scoring on his home debut against Rotherham in December. Dom Telford (right) of Blackpool has attracted interest from Stoke, who made a bid for the player in January . City manager Mark Hughes made an approach in January which was rejected but has continually sent scouts to monitor his progress and Telford could reject a contract at Bloomfield Road to switch to the Britannia. Hughes is keen to add more quality young players and has already moved for Barcelona's Moha El Mouriachi, 19, and Thibaud Verlinden, 15, of Standard Liege. Blackpool's Mark Waddington, 18, remains a target for Brighton. Fulham and QPR are showing interest in Celtic defender Efe Ambrose. Both London clubs are looking to re-shape their squads in the summer and Ambrose would still fit into their wage structure. The 26-year-old Nigeria international who has 46 caps is ready to leave Celtic and has interest from Premier League sides also but is keen on a move to London. QPR will lose Steven Caulker, Rio Ferdinand, possibly Richard Dunne and expect Nedum Onouha to move on also. Celtic defender Efe Ambrose is ready to leave the club and is wanted by London rivals Fulham and QPR . West Ham have revived interest in Pedro Obiang of Sampdoria as they consider midfield targets. As reported by Sportsmail, West Ham have doubts about a permanent deal for Alex Song with Inter Milan also showing an interest. Roberto Mancini has Song and Lucas Leiva of Liverpool on his back-up list should he fail to sign Yaya Toure from Manchester City. West Ham want more energy in midfield and have considered James McArthur of Crystal Palace but Obiang remains on their radar too. Spanish-born Obiang is a Spain U21 international and began his career with Atletico Madrid. West Ham showed interest last summer and in January.

The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks – claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'\", \"1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 68 . 2. Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 55 . 3. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 51 . Nico Rosberg was brooding, his face stony, his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger. He was sitting next to Lewis Hamilton — as close as the German had got to his Mercedes team-mate all afternoon of the Chinese Grand Prix — at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations. Rosberg, whose usual coiffured, Euro-chic sheen had vanished, alleged that Hamilton had selfishly tried to spoil his race. The record states that Hamilton won, Rosberg was second and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel third. But Rosberg feared he might be overtaken by Vettel before the second round of pit stops when Hamilton, then leading from pole position, slowed down a few fractions of a second — to conserve his tyres, he said.

Rosberg asked the team to get Hamilton to speed up, an instruction they issued and one with which the Briton complied. ‘I wasn’t controlling his race; I was controlling my own race,’ said Hamilton, indignantly. ‘I had no real threat from Nico.’ But Rosberg said: ‘It’s interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace. That opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me.’ Hamilton countered: ‘My job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up.’ Boys, boys. It took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public. We are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out. It was easy to sympathise with Rosberg but difficult to agree with him. Even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends, he must be reaching his wits’ end, frustrated to distraction, wondering how on earth he can possibly beat Hamilton when he is on form. It seems, to this cod psychologist, that it was Rosberg’s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race. ‘We have first and second,’ said the three-time world champion.

One thing is clear: Lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end. There’s nothing more to say. True, Lewis will drive selfishly. These guys are egocentric b******s. It is the only way to win the championship, and Nico is the same if the s*** hits the fan. Lewis was better this weekend. ‘There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that’s it.’ For Hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track, the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season, ending up in a gravel trap, his championship hopes devastated in 2007. He again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear Max Verstappen’s crippled Toro Rosso. The safety car came out. Anti-climax though it was, a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for Hamilton. He was congratulated over the radio for having ‘the full house’: pole, fastest lap and race win. It was a flawless performance. The race posed many tantalising questions. The first was whether Ferrari could match Mercedes in the temperate Shanghai climate, as they managed in Malaysia a fortnight ago? They were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook Rosberg. They will keep Mercedes on their toes, and that is balm for the sport. Hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate Hamilton at the third consecutive race . Hamilton, who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year’s title, made the perfect start. He inclined his car right on the grid, covering Rosberg next to him, before darting through the first, right-hand corner in front. Contest over before it started. An honourable mention for 17-year-old Verstappen, who drove his Toro Rosso with great elan. He put his car down the inside of Marcus Ericsson’s Sauber, causing Max’s father and former racer Jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage. He then applauded in admiration. Alas, Verstappen’s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight. Red Bull’s woes continued with Daniil Kvyat’s Renault engine billowing grey smoke into the Shanghai air. Their other car, driven by Daniel Ricciardo, was ninth. McLaren were even less successful than Red Bull, again. Jenson Button was demoted a place to 14th, having collided with Pastor Maldonado’s Lotus. Button’s team-mate Fernando Alonso was 12th after being lapped by Vettel, his replacement at Ferrari. Vettel was smiling afterwards, but not as widely as Hamilton. Max Verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes, but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired . Jenson Button, who finished 13th, was involved in a collision with Pastor Maldonado towards the end of the race .\", \"The body of a girl who vanished on her fifth birthday while playing at a Texas marina has been found in the water nearby.

Kemah is 25 miles southeast of Houston.\", 'Boston (CNN)When the bomb went off, Steve Woolfenden thought he was still standing. That was because, as he lay on the ground, he was still holding the handles of his son\\'s stroller. He pulled back the stroller\\'s cover and saw that his son, Leo, 3, was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head. Woolfenden checked Leo for other injuries and thought, \"Let\\'s get out of here.\" That was before he noticed his Achilles tendon, which resembled transparent tape covered in blood, and his left tibia protruding from his boot. The boot was next to his left stump, he testified before a federal jury Thursday, the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the Boston Marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that Tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless. The defense, led by famed death penalty opponent Judy Clarke, is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain Tsarnaev\\'s difficult upbringing. Clarke will begin those efforts Monday. A group of Tsarnaev\\'s relatives arrived at Boston\\'s Logan International Airport on Thursday, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, but it\\'s not clear if they plan to testify. The jury must decide whether the 21-year-old, who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother, will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison. Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher for the Novartis Institutes, recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort Leo. The boy cried, \"Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!\" he testified. Amid the stench of \"burning hair, blood, sulfur,\" a good Samaritan emerged. He gave Woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed Leo to safety. \"I was completely terrified because I didn\\'t know if I was ever going to see my son again. There was blood all over the sidewalk, all around me,\" he said. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, spent 14 years in the U.S. Army as a combat surgeon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices, he testified, and what he saw in Boston that day wasn\\'t much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones. \"I arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up,\" he said. \"I looked across the patients and I knew immediately, without anyone having to tell me, exactly what the wounding mechanism was.\" Heather Abbott had no such experience, so when one of the two bombs exploded, sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a \"puddle of chaos and blood and glass,\" her instinct was to run. But she couldn\\'t. Her foot felt like it was on fire, she testified. Two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a Hail Mary. She called for her husband. He picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant. \"I saw blood pouring out of my foot,\" she said. She finally got to a hospital, and after three attempts to save her foot, which was missing its entire heel, a doctor told her she had a decision: She could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee. She chose the latter. \"It was probably the hardest decision I\\'ve had to make,\" she testified. Another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the Tsarnaev brothers\\' attack, Marc Fucarile, recounted the two bombs going off. \"I stepped back, and the next thing I remember was looking up at the sky,\" he testified, adding that he remembered \"a lot of yelling, a lot of screaming, people crying out for tourniquets.\" A nurse was sitting on his chest, and someone said, \"Oh, s***, he\\'s on fire!\" He tried to undo his belt and got a third-degree burn because the buckle was so hot. A firefighter would later tell Fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter. He doesn\\'t remember that. In addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body, doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit. He still gets blisters. \"So where the prosthetic attaches on your butt, it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds,\" he said. And though his left leg survived, it was severely burned, his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered, he said. He hopes to save the left leg, he testified, but it\\'s likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee. He takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning, 22 in afternoon, 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries, he said. One of the most dramatic points in Thursday\\'s testimony involved the death of young Martin Richard. The prosecution showed close-up video of the 8-year-old, who was only 3½ feet from one of the bombs, according to the FBI\\'s re-creation of the crime scene. His parents, Bill and Denise, are opposed to Tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase, though Bill Richard did testify during the guilt phase. Dr. King told the court that Martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground, meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso. It\\'s highly unlikely the boy died instantly, King said. Explaining that Martin died of rapid blood loss, King testified, \"Receptors are generally not responsive to cutting. If you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver, it generally does not hurt. What hurts is the stretching and twisting. ... Intestines were pulled and twisted; that would have caused visceral type pain.\" Woolfenden, the biomedical researcher, recalled seeing Martin and his mother shortly after the good Samaritan took Woolfenden\\'s son, Leo, to safety. \"I saw Martin\\'s face, and I could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured,\" he said, . Martin\\'s hair was singed, his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape. As for Martin\\'s torso, \"I saw an immense amount of blood. I was really, really terrified,\" Woolfenden said. He recalled Denise Richard pleading with her son, saying, \"please\" and \"Martin\" over and over. Woolfenden placed his hand on Denise Richard\\'s back, he said. She turned to ask Woolfenden if he was OK. He said he was, and she turned her attention back to Martin. But no response came. According to testimony, Martin\\'s aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast. He bled to death on the sidewalk, and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs. CNN\\'s Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.', '(CNN)As thousands of South Africans took to the streets of the city of Durban to rally against violence and xenophobia, an online community has joined the protests. The marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives. During the protest march Thursday, Twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns. #PeaceMarch and #SayNoToXenophobia were some of the most popular. South African Police Services said more than 10,000 people attended the march, including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations. Hashtags are now pouring out of South Africa. But many are asking, some via Twitter, is it enough to fight #xenophobia? Attacks this week in Durban alone have killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. For South African Tim Flack, tweeting wasn\\'t going to make a bit of difference. Flack, who lives in Cape Town, has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who he said referred to foreigners as \"lice\" and has said \"they should pack their bags and go.\" \"People listen to him,\" Flack said. \"He is a monarch. The Zulu people in South Africa take him very seriously, they don\\'t question what he says.\" Flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they weren\\'t enough. So he filed a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission, and then tweeted about it. \"The activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times,\" Flack said. \"I want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it won\\'t cost them anything, but I will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being.\" Now, the Human Rights Commission must decide whether to investigate Flack\\'s allegations against the King, who denies fueling any violence. Flack hopes others will also make complaints. Flack added that Zulus aren\\'t the only people in South Africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment. \"People are frustrated and unemployed, and people in South Africa pay foreign nationals a lot less,\" he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants. \"A domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house, whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand, so it causes resentment.\" Imtiaz Sooliman, founder and chairman of the Gift of Givers Foundation in Durban, doesn\\'t think most South Africans are against foreigners. \"South Africans are against xenophobia,\" said Sooliman, who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals. Gift of Givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the South African government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees, he said, passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs. The organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with #xenophobia. Why? \"In South Africa, everyone knows xenophobia,\" Sooliman said, \"and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand. So if you say #tsunami or #war, people follow it. So here, people say #xenophobia, and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster, so you are going to post what people understand.\" He said South Africans also have been going to the camps, which are on sports fields with makeshift tents, bringing cooked food and other necessities. \"This is different from what happened in 2008,\" Sooliman said. That year, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. Sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence, community engagement is happening now as it never happened before. It is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story: #WeAreAfrica.

Chris Ramsey believes Sunday's west London derby is more crucial to QPR than it is to Chelsea . Ramsey puts QPR wideman Junior Hoilett through his paces during the Hoops' training session on Friday . And, with games running out, Ramsey feels Chelsea's lead at the top means the game takes on extra significance for the hosts. 'It's a big game for us,' he said. 'They can afford to have a blip and still win the league but on the flip side, we need to pick up every point we can. 'We all know what it means to the supporters - at this stage of the season, with what is at stake for both teams, it gives it added spice.' Charlie Austin celebrates with Matt Phillips after scoring during QPR's 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday . Defender Clint Hill, who scored in Tuesday night's 3-3 draw at Aston Villa, enjoyed the taste of victory in his first west London derby when QPR won 1-0 at home to Chelsea in 2011. That game may now be remembered more for the verbal clash between John Terry and Anton Ferdinand which landed the Chelsea skipper a £220,000 fine and a four-game ban for racial abuse, but Hill wants to see the positives from that performance replicated on Sunday. 'I think we shocked them that day,' he told Hoops Player. 'If we can show the same desire both on and off the pitch then hopefully we can get a result again. Nobody expects us to win but we believe we can give them a game. 'We are playing Chelsea who are top of the Premier League and if you can't get up for that challenge then there's something wrong.' Former striker Heidar Helguson celebrates after scoring in QPR's 1-0 home win over Chelsea in October 2011 . Defender Clint Hill believes QPR can get a result if the side show the same desire as they did four years ago .\", \"The parents of a terminally ill boy have fulfilled his dying wish by getting married at his bedside in hospital. Corey Edwards, from Teignmouth, Devon more than anything wanted to see his parents Craig, 28, and Jemma, 21, tie the knot. The five-year-old was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect at the age of seven months and since then has undergone eight open-heart operations and other treatments. Jemma and Craig Edwards listen to their wedding vows during their marriage at Bristol Children's Hospital . Corey Edwards' job was to hold the rings for his parents during the marriage ceremony . The five-year-old is suffering from a terminal congenital heart defect and had often asked his parents why they were not married . Corey has been on the paediatric intensive care unit at Bristol Children's Hospital since January and when doctors gave his parents the devastating news that he may not live much longer, Mr and Mrs Edwards decided to get married. They had been engaged for three years but plans to tie the knot were put on hold due to the birth of their daughters, two-year-old Isabelle and six-month-old Caitlyn, and Corey's ill health. When they learnt of their son's wish, they felt there was no time like the present and, with the help of staff and friends made at the hospital, they were able to organise the whole service within 48 hours. They made history when they became the first couple to marry at the hospital but had to get special permission from the Archbishop of Canterbury. The law allows couples to marry in hospital if one of them is desperately ill and that did not apply in this case. But a law dating back to Henry VIII gives the Archbishop of Canterbury special dispensation to allow weddings in hospital for 'pastoral reasons'. Mr Edwards, a council worker, said: 'A couple of weeks ago we were told they didn't think he would go home. We keep hoping that he will but it just looks less likely each day. 'When we knew Corey's wishes, everyone on the paediatric intensive care unit and Ward 32, including staff and friends, got together to help us. The Edwards had been engaged for three years but decided to fast track their wedding when they discovered their son Corey may not live much longer . 'We both planned to get married years ago but decided we wouldn't get married without Corey there, so the only way we could do it was in hospital. 'He's asked quite a few times why we are not married, so we thought we would make it a special day and cheer him up a bit. 'The Bishop of Bristol had to write to the Archbishop of Canterbury to get special permission for us to marry in the hospital and we are so grateful he agreed. 'When we got the go-ahead, we only had a matter of days to plan. We rushed into town to buy a dress and suit and made do with our engagement rings as wedding rings. 'We couldn't believe the generosity of all those involved. One nurse helped to do Jemma's hair, whilst another two members of staff made the cake and iced it. 'Chairs were pulled together to form an aisle and decorations were put up to make it feel like a wedding venue. 'We were married by the hospital's chaplain, Rev Stephen Oram, who was very excited to be sharing this occasion with us. 'However, the most important thing for us was having our son Corey at our side, holding the rings and wearing his suit. 'We couldn't have been more proud of him. We were also incredibly lucky to have our daughters there and the support of so many.' Mr Edwards added: 'It turned into a really, really amazing day and Corey was so proud. He looked very handsome. I think he really enjoyed it, which was the main thing. 'Getting married is usually the bride and groom's special day, which it was, but it's more Corey's special day because he is such a special boy. 'It was nice to share our special day with the people who have helped us enjoy Corey's short life. It has got to the point where there isn't more they can do now, which is obviously very hard. 'Instead of being at his bedside crying the whole time at least on that one day we had a real special day. We know he was happy that day. 'When he's home and well you wouldn't know he is a cardiac patient. He's happy, running around and loves to play.' William Booth, the paediatric intensive care unit matron, said: 'It was a privilege to share Craig and Jemma's special day with their children Corey, Isabelle and Caitlyn, family and friends. 'The whole hospital was abuzz with excitement and one of the nurses made and iced a cake, others brought in flowers and gifts for the newlyweds. 'Lots of the nursing and medical teams involved in Corey's care came in over the Easter break to share this special occasion with them all.' Pictured front from left to right on the wedding day is Corey Edwards and his sisters Isabelle and Caitlyn. Across the back is their mother Jemma, Reverend Stephen Oram and their father Craig Edwards . Rev Oram said: 'Henry VIII gave the then Archbishop of Canterbury this special power to by-pass the law. 'It was that ancient law from several hundred years ago that was enacted allowing Mr and Mrs Edwards to get married. It meant a little bit of paperwork to fill out but we were able to get that done in 48 hours. 'It was very emotional and it was emotional for many reasons. The family and the ward knew how special this was for them and it was fulfilling the wish of a dying child. 'It was also emotional because we knew the outcome for poor Corey isn't going to be a good outcome and everyone was just aware of the specialness of the day for Mr and Mrs Edwards and Corey.' The newlyweds spent their wedding night at their son's bedside and later returned to the Ronald McDonald House where they are staying whilst Corey is in hospital. Mr Edwards said: 'It may not have been the day we had initially planned in our heads but it didn't matter to us. 'To have our son there meant more than anything and it will be a day we will never forget. We can't thank the staff enough for what they have done for us and Corey and we would like them to know how much we appreciate their hard work and dedication.' Jemma and Craig Edwards sign their wedding register and the hospital bedside of their five-year-old son Corey .\", \"The crew of a replica pirate schooner were forced to abandon ship after their vessel lost power in rough seas off the coast of Maine. Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard life boats on Tuesday, leaving the Canadian charter ship adrift 30 miles east of Portland, Coast Guard officials said. The tall ship reported having issues with the engines around 12.35 a.m. on Monday, and said the sails had become wrapped around the mast. Scroll down for video . Mid-sea rescue: Coast Guard life boats facilitated a rescue of crew members from the Liana's Ransom, who had to leap from the replica schooner . Two lifeboat crews were dispatched from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to try and tow the vessel to shore, but 10-foot swells caused a tow line to break. The crew was ordered to put on immersion suits and abandon the schooner, according to a press release from the Coast Guard. In a video of the rescue, a man in a jacket successfully makes the jump from the Liana's Ransom to the lifeboat as the two ships pitch in the rough seas. CBS reports crew member Luke Arbuckle came up short while attempting to make the jump to the Coast Guard ship. 'Apparently the ship separated just as I jumped over, and I ended up in the water,' Arbuckle said. Arbuckle's forehead struck the side of the boat while jumping, and he was rescued and transported by a Coast Guard helicopter to the hospital, where he was treated and later released. Safe and sound: The crew was reportedly dehydrated and seasick after being caught in choppy weather early Monday morning . Pulled out: Crew member Luke Arbuckle shorted the jump as the two boats tilted away from each other and struck his head against the boat before being airlifted to the hospital . Ahoy: The 85-foot-long ship was on its way to St Maarten in the Caribbean with nine crew members on its first voyage of the season . The 24-year-old captain of the Liana's Ransom, Ryan Tilley, was the last crew member to depart the drifting ship, his father, Joseph Tilley, wrote on the ship's Facebook page. 'Seeing the ship crippled, damaged and left floating there as we motored away with the Coast Guard was probably one of the worst moments of my life, but you have to put lives first,' Ryan told WCVB. The boat was towed to  Kittery Point Yacht Yard in Eliot, Massachusetts, on Tuesday evening where it will be repaired. The ship's website states the vessel was on its way to St Maarten, which was to be its new home port, when it lost engine power. The schooner, which has a 70-passenger capacity, was built to resemble ships used by privateers and pirates in the 1700s and is equipped with replica black powder cannons, according to the site.\", \"Ed Miliband has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he ‘blubbed’ while watching Pride, a British film released last year. It’s a rose-tinted, nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th-century British history. Every drop of sentiment is wrung out of the story, with brave young men and women risking their lives to take on an evil dictator. So what is it about, this heartwarming tale of British derring-do? The Battle of Britain? The Falklands crisis? The Iraq War? Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband confessed that he 'blubbed' during the British film Pride that centres on the 1984 miners' strike . No. It centres on the 1984 miners’ strike and the plucky underdogs are a London-based group of gays and lesbians who travel to South Wales to express their solidarity with the local branch of the National Union of Mineworkers. Needless to say, the evil dictator who they’re fighting is Margaret Thatcher. Miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep . What a surprise that such a storyline led the Labour leader to exclaim: ‘Justine [his wife] and I watched it recently and blubbed.’ I’m sure Pride isn’t the only British film that the right-on Milibands will have cried their way through. For there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. In truth, these movies — Pride, Billy Elliot (also a piece of miners’ strike propaganda that depicted Thatcher as the Devil incarnate), Made In Dagenham (about a car factory strike) and The Full Monty (about a group of redundant Sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money) —might as well have been party political broadcasts for Labour. For the keystone of these Left-wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history, portraying Britain’s recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists, fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable, and unfeeling bosses, bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords. There is no acknowledgment by the film-makers that the unions’ greed and bully-boy tactics all but destroyed the British economy, or that their beloved welfare state (which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country) relies on a strong, unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat. The film Pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the Left: bolshie unions and minorities (in this case, homosexuals). Naturally, it doesn’t take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life-and-death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their Welsh colliery members. Scroll down for video . Wringing every drop of emotion from Left-wing audiences, the director ends the film with a scene showing bus-loads of miners turning up to support a gay pride march in London’s Hyde Park, as singer Billy Bragg’s There Is Power In A Union comes blasting over the soundtrack. Strangely absent from the story, of course, is any reference to the role the NUM played in bringing down successive British governments — both Conservative and Labour alike — and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped Britain in the Seventies and culminated in the Winter of Discontent. Nor is there any mention of the attempt by Arthur Scargill, the loony-Left leader of the NUM, to persuade communist Russia — not to mention Colonel Gaddafi — to bankroll the strike, which his members hadn’t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot. Billy Elliott is another film about ‘brave and downtrodden’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories . The same historical revisionism is exhibited in Made In Dagenham, about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. As with Pride, the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of Left-wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause — in this case, male and female shop-floor workers. At no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive. The viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified. Made In Dagenham’s political message couldn’t be clearer, and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the Equal Pay Act by a Labour government in 1970. A more honest assessment of the British car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as Derek Robinson — ‘Red Robbo’ — at British Leyland helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large. Indeed, a more realistic ending to Made In Dagenham would have pointed out that the Ford factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000, thanks, in part, to rising labour costs — pushed up by militant unions. Brassed off starring Pete Postlethwaite and Ewan McGregor portrayed Margaret Thatcher as an orge . Then again, that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of Britain’s industrial base. Perhaps the most glaring omission from such Left-wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of Margaret Thatcher were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the Seventies. The fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health, able to hold its head up high again in the world. But in so many Left-inspired British films of the past 25 years, whether Brassed Off (about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a Tory government), The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, Thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working-class communities and replace nice Left-wing values with nasty Right-wing ones. Inevitably, the period before Thatcher is depicted as a golden age, a pastoral idyll straight out of a Hovis commercial, while the Britain she left behind is portrayed as a money-grubbing spiritual wasteland. Is it any wonder that such films make Ed Miliband, brought up by a Marxist academic father, ‘blub’? The only exception to this disgraceful series of truth-twisting films was The Iron Lady, in which Britain’s first female Prime Minister was shown in a more nuanced light, almost in spite of its makers’ Left-wing instincts. Made In Dagenham is about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. It is broadly unsympathetic — there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia, which suggests an element of hostility — but actress Meryl Streep brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that Baroness Thatcher emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of Left-wing mythology. Not surprisingly, The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making. No doubt if it had depicted Thatcher as a cruel monster, the same critics would have acclaimed it an out-and-out masterpiece. But not to worry. This mistake was corrected the following year by Labour-supporting Danny Boyle. In his lavish £27 million opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics he made no direct reference to Britain’s greatest postwar Prime Minister — which was odd in itself — but left viewers in no doubt about his view of Thatcherism. Once again we were treated to the familiar Left-wing version of Britain’s history, in which top-hatted Tory industrialists, determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills, are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes, trade unionists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists. Boyle’s collaborator, Frank Cottrell Boyce, condemned Thatcher for being ‘insufficiently British’ and said ‘although she draped herself in the Union Flag, she never seemed to understand this country’. The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being ‘shallow’ and ‘superficial’, an example of ‘self-important’ film-making . The truth is, it’s the Left that doesn’t understand contemporary Britain. We are not a drab, depressed country, riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality, as you would think from watching films such as Pride and Billy Elliot. On the contrary, crime is lower, life expectancy higher and the standard of living better than at any time in our past. The rights of women, gays and ethnic minorities are all robustly defended by politicians of both Left and Right, and our schools and hospitals have never been better (or more lavishly funded). Britain now has the fastest-growing economy in the Western world, with more jobs being created last year in Yorkshire — ironically, the county where so many of these Left-wing propaganda films have been set — than in the whole of France. Couldn’t we have just one home-grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern Britain and brings a tear of pride to us all, rather than Left-wing drivel that triggers ‘blubbing’ from Ed Miliband?\", \"Another day, another baton change, another away defeat for Middlesbrough. Aitor Karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from Watford were it not for the probability they’d spend most of the journey travelling in circles. This was that kind of game, a top-of-the-table occasion when Middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale – they did not create, they did not contain. They might have survived with deficiencies in one department, but not both. What a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season. What a cruel time for the Championship’s best defence to explode at the seams. Odion Ighalo's shot flies into the top corner of Dimi Konstantopoulos' net on 65 minutes . Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Cathcart (Connolly 60), Angella, Hoban; Paredes, Guedioura (Layun 90), Watson, Tozser, Anya; Deeney, Ighalo (Vydra 69). Subs not used:\\xa0Bond, Pudil, Munari, Abdi. Booked: Guedioura, Layun. Goals: Deeney 37, Ighalo 65. Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Tiendalli (Kalas 63), Woodgate, Amorebieta, Friend; Leadbitter, Clayton (Forshaw 84); Adomah, Tomlin (Kike 62), Reach; Bamford. Subs not used:\\xa0Ripley, Gibson, Whitehead, Vossen. Booked: Reach. Referee:\\xa0Mike Jones (Cheshire) Attendance: 19,656. They gifted Troy Deeney his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to Odion Ighalo scoring his 19th in the second half. With that, Watford rose and Middlesbrough fell. That has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division, for which everyone and no-one has staked a claim. The Championship lead which Boro held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times, with Watford back in prominence and Karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note. Karanka said: ‘The players are completely destroyed but I am very proud of them. We have players who have come from League One and other teams in the Championship, a lot of young players, and we are fighting with the best teams in the Championship. No one could have expected this position. ‘The people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second. I don’t want to forget our position is amazing.’ True enough, but the reality is Boro have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot. They were woeful in falling at Bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games. Jonathan Woodgate slides in vain to try and block Troy Deeney's opening goal . The Watford captain managed to slide the ball under Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos . Deeney celebrates with his team-mates after giving Watford a first-half lead . But their misery has been Watford’s gain. What a luxury to have two strikers as effective as Deeney and Ighalo. They were, as Karanka said, ‘the difference’. And in the context of the season, their combined 39 goals are pulling the sleigh. Here, they had help. In the first instance, for Deeney’s 37th-minute opener, Jonathan Woodgate and Dwight Tiendalli made a hash of the basics. Adlene Guedioura was given too much time to cross from the right and Woodgate misread the flight, allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him. Tiendalli could have covered but was out of position. At this level, in that situation, there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than Deeney. His touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns. He is the only Watford player in history to do that; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level. ‘He’s a Premier League player,’ said Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic. ‘It’s just a question of whether we are all together as a Premier League team.’ Watford made it 2-0 with 25 minutes to go. Again, the ease with which Ighalo turned Woodgate will have bothered Karanka, as will Grant Leadbitter’s sloppy concession of the ball in the build-up. But, really, it was all about the finish, the striker’s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area. Ighalo said he only joined Watford for the prospect of Premier League football. He might just get it. Jokanovic said: ‘I expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future. But in front of us is a very serious job.’ Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes gets a boot to the face from Middlesbrough forward Patrick bamford . Gomes points to the heavens after Ighalo's goal put Watford 2-0 up and settled the game .\"]\n",
