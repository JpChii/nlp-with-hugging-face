    "# Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of profession, everyone has to wade through ocean of documents at some point to find the information for their questions.  To make matters worse, we're constantly reminded by search engines there are better ways to search! For instance the earch query \"When did Marie Curie win her first Nobel Prize?\" And google get the correct answer of \"1903\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So how was this search done? Google first retrieved 319,000 documents that were relevant to query, then performed a post processing step to extract the answer snippet with the coressponding passage and web page. But for a more trickier question like \"Which guitar tuning is best?\" We'll get web pages instead of an answer snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach behind this technology is called *question answering*(QA), but the most common is *extractive QA* which involves questions where answers can be identified as a span in a text document, where the document might be a web page, article, legal document etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two stage process of retrieving relevant documents and then extracting answers from this is the basis of many modern QA systems like semantic search, intellegint assistants and automated information extractors. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** We're covering only extractive QA. There are others,\n",
    " * community QA Ex: In stack overflow, all the relevant question answer pairs will be retrived for the new Question from user and then using semantic similarity search to find the closest maching answer to this question.\n",
    " * long-form QA, which aims to generate complex paragraph-length answers to open ended questions like \"Why sky is blue?\"\n",
    " * QA can be done over tables as well, and transformer models like TAPAS can even peroform aggregations to produce the final answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use QA system to solve a common problem facing ecommerce websites: helping consumers evaluate a product by answering specific queries. We'll see that the customer reviews can be used as a rich and challenging source of information for QA. Along the way we'll learn transformers capbality of *reading comprehehsion* and how the model can extract meaning from text."

    "Let's say we want to buy a smartphone, and we've question on nightmode camera capbalities. This information is not readily available in product description. We can find the answer for this in reviews by other customers. But we might've to comb throuch thousands of reviews to find the relevant answer. It'll be great if we can have a search like google right? Let's do this using transformers!"

This is why it's easier to answer fatcual questions like \"What's the capital of a country\"\n",
    "Second, important parts of the question do not appear in review at all, so we can't use shortcuts like keyword search or paraphrasing the input question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these points, SubQA is a greate dataset to benchamrk review-based QA models, sicne user-generated content in the example resembles what we might encounter in the wild.\n",
    "\n",

    "  * *Narrow QA* answers question about a single product less documents to search\n",

    "\n",
    " The (question, review, [answer setences]) format of SubjQA(used in [7-question-answering.ipynb notebook usecase for qa](../notebooks/7-question-answering.ipynb)) is commonly used in extractive QA datasets and was pioneered in Stanford Question Answering Dataset(SQuAD). \n",
    "\n",
    " * SQuAD is a famous dataset to test the abilit of machines(models) to read a passage of text and answer questions about it\n",
    " * This dataset was created from several hundred articles from wikipedia, where each of the article was partioned into paragraphs. Then crowdworkers were asked to generate questions and answers for each paragraph.\n",
    " * In the first crowdworkers version of SQuAD, answers for questions were guaranteed to be in paragraphs.\n",
    " * Soon sequence to sequence models outperformed humans and predicted spans of answers for question in the context(paragraphs, reviews etc.)\n",
    " * SQuAD 2.0 was created by augmenting SQuAD 1.1 with a set of adversial questions that were relevant to the passage but can't be answered from the passage contents alone. This became a better benchmark for evaluation qa capabalities of machines.\n",
    " * SOTA models as of 2022 with most models since 2019 surpasses human performance.\n",
    "    *qa sota models timeline*\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt](../notes/images/7-question-answering/qa-sota-models.png)\n",
    "* However this superhuman performance does not appear to reflect genuine reading comprehension, since answers to these \"unanswerable\" questions can be found by looking at antonymns in passages. \n",
    "* To address these problems Google released the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset which involves fact-seeking questions obtainef from Google Search users.\n",
    "* The answers in NQ are much longer than in SQuAD and present a more challenging benchmark.\n",

    "\n",

    "In general we'll start with a pretrained model and evaluate it on the dataset to use it as a baseline and then fine-tune the model for the use case. But for extractive QA , we can actually start with fine-tuned model because the structure of labels remain the same. Since our training set is realtivley small with only 1,295 samples, A good strategy is to use a model fine-tuned on large-scale QA dataset like SQuAD.\n",
