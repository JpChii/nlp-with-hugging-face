    "# Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of profession, everyone has to wade through ocean of documents at some point to find the information for their questions.  To make matters worse, we're constantly reminded by search engines there are better ways to search! For instance the earch query \"When did Marie Curie win her first Nobel Prize?\" And google get the correct answer of \"1903\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So how was this search done? Google first retrieved 319,000 documents that were relevant to query, then performed a post processing step to extract the answer snippet with the coressponding passage and web page. But for a more trickier question like \"Which guitar tuning is best?\" We'll get web pages instead of an answer snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach behind this technology is called *question answering*(QA), but the most common is *extractive QA* which involves questions where answers can be identified as a span in a text document, where the document might be a web page, article, legal document etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two stage process of retrieving relevant documents and then extracting answers from this is the basis of many modern QA systems like semantic search, intellegint assistants and automated information extractors. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** We're covering only extractive QA. There are others,\n",
    " * community QA Ex: In stack overflow, all the relevant question answer pairs will be retrived for the new Question from user and then using semantic similarity search to find the closest maching answer to this question.\n",
    " * long-form QA, which aims to generate complex paragraph-length answers to open ended questions like \"Why sky is blue?\"\n",
    " * QA can be done over tables as well, and transformer models like TAPAS can even peroform aggregations to produce the final answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use QA system to solve a common problem facing ecommerce websites: helping consumers evaluate a product by answering specific queries. We'll see that the customer reviews can be used as a rich and challenging source of information for QA. Along the way we'll learn transformers capbality of *reading comprehehsion* and how the model can extract meaning from text."

    "Let's say we want to buy a smartphone, and we've question on nightmode camera capbalities. This information is not readily available in product description. We can find the answer for this in reviews by other customers. But we might've to comb throuch thousands of reviews to find the relevant answer. It'll be great if we can have a search like google right? Let's do this using transformers!"

This is why it's easier to answer fatcual questions like \"What's the capital of a country\"\n",
    "Second, important parts of the question do not appear in review at all, so we can't use shortcuts like keyword search or paraphrasing the input question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these points, SubQA is a greate dataset to benchamrk review-based QA models, sicne user-generated content in the example resembles what we might encounter in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** QA systems are categorized accordig to the domains it has access to while answering the questions. \n",
    "  * *Narrow QA* answers question about a single product less documents to search\n",

    "\n",
    " The (question, review, [answer setences]) format of SubjQA(used in [7-question-answering.ipynb notebook usecase for qa](../notebooks/7-question-answering.ipynb)) is commonly used in extractive QA datasets and was pioneered in Stanford Question Answering Dataset(SQuAD). \n",
    "\n",
    " * SQuAD is a famous dataset to test the abilit of machines(models) to read a passage of text and answer questions about it\n",
    " * This dataset was created from several hundred articles from wikipedia, where each of the article was partioned into paragraphs. Then crowdworkers were asked to generate questions and answers for each paragraph.\n",
    " * In the first crowdworkers version of SQuAD, answers for questions were guaranteed to be in paragraphs.\n",
    " * Soon sequence to sequence models outperformed humans and predicted spans of answers for question in the context(paragraphs, reviews etc.)\n",
    " * SQuAD 2.0 was created by augmenting SQuAD 1.1 with a set of adversial questions that were relevant to the passage but can't be answered from the passage contents alone. This became a better benchmark for evaluation qa capabalities of machines.\n",
    " * SOTA models as of 2022 with most models since 2019 surpasses human performance.\n",
    "    *qa sota models timeline*\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt](../notes/images/7-question-answering/qa-sota-models.png)\n",
    "* However this superhuman performance does not appear to reflect genuine reading comprehension, since answers to these \"unanswerable\" questions can be found by looking at antonymns in passages. \n",
    "* To address these problems Google released the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset which involves fact-seeking questions obtainef from Google Search users.\n",
    "* The answers in NQ are much longer than in SQuAD and present a more challenging benchmark.\n",

    "In general we'll start with a pretrained model and evaluate it on the dataset to use it as a baseline and then fine-tune the model for the use case. But for extractive QA , we can actually start with fine-tuned model because the structure of labels remain the same. Since our training set is realtivley small with only 1,295 samples, A good strategy is to use a model fine-tuned on large-scale QA dataset like SQuAD.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our example above, we've fed the pipeline or model both question and context. But in reality we'll get only the query from user and we've get the context from our corpus. There are few ways to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple and easiest approach is to concatenate all the reviews available as a single context and feed it with question to the model. The bottleneck will be the computation to process, because the context is big due to concatenation. Let's assume it takes 100 milliseconds to process a review with 30 reviews and the model will take 3 seconds latency after users input which won't work in an ecommerece application.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, moder QA system uses retriever-reader approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retriever-Reader architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Retriever is responsible for retrieving relevant documents for the user query. They are categorized as sparse and dense\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Sparse Retrievers*: This uses word frequencies to represent a document. The query is also a sparse vector. The relevancy of document for the query is determined by computing an inner product of both vectors.\n",
    "2. *Dense Retrievers*: This stores documents as contextualized embeddings. The query is converted into a dense vector using encoder like transformers. Then both query and documents are compared, semantic meaning is available with embeddings. This allows for a more accurate search of documents by understanding the content of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reader\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsible for extracting an answer from the documnts provided by the retriver. These can be reading comprehension models(extract answers from text) or free-form answers from generative tranformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be post-processing after retriver or reader and both as well. Like ranking the documents from retriever to remove noisy passages or postprocessing answer by combining answer from various passages in a long document.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to retriever and reader an QA system requries two more components:\n",

I don\\'t get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I\\'ve had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother\\'s tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7\" is just perfect for me. It\\'s light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it\\'s fresh on my mind, and I\\'m reviewing everything I read.I didn\\'t realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I\\'ve always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I\\'ve even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what\\'s on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn\\'t last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn\\'t take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I\\'ve been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly. I can tolerate it for short periods to play a few games. However, I simply can\\'t hold the Kindle Fire long enough for reading.
