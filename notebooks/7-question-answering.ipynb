    "# Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of profession, everyone has to wade through ocean of documents at some point to find the information for their questions.  To make matters worse, we're constantly reminded by search engines there are better ways to search! For instance the earch query \"When did Marie Curie win her first Nobel Prize?\" And google get the correct answer of \"1903\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So how was this search done? Google first retrieved 319,000 documents that were relevant to query, then performed a post processing step to extract the answer snippet with the coressponding passage and web page. But for a more trickier question like \"Which guitar tuning is best?\" We'll get web pages instead of an answer snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach behind this technology is called *question answering*(QA), but the most common is *extractive QA* which involves questions where answers can be identified as a span in a text document, where the document might be a web page, article, legal document etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two stage process of retrieving relevant documents and then extracting answers from this is the basis of many modern QA systems like semantic search, intellegint assistants and automated information extractors. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** We're covering only extractive QA. There are others,\n",
    " * community QA Ex: In stack overflow, all the relevant question answer pairs will be retrived for the new Question from user and then using semantic similarity search to find the closest maching answer to this question.\n",
    " * long-form QA, which aims to generate complex paragraph-length answers to open ended questions like \"Why sky is blue?\"\n",
    " * QA can be done over tables as well, and transformer models like TAPAS can even peroform aggregations to produce the final answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use QA system to solve a common problem facing ecommerce websites: helping consumers evaluate a product by answering specific queries. We'll see that the customer reviews can be used as a rich and challenging source of information for QA. Along the way we'll learn transformers capbality of *reading comprehehsion* and how the model can extract meaning from text."

    "Let's say we want to buy a smartphone, and we've question on nightmode camera capbalities. This information is not readily available in product description. We can find the answer for this in reviews by other customers. But we might've to comb throuch thousands of reviews to find the relevant answer. It'll be great if we can have a search like google right? Let's do this using transformers!"

This is why it's easier to answer fatcual questions like \"What's the capital of a country\"\n",
    "Second, important parts of the question do not appear in review at all, so we can't use shortcuts like keyword search or paraphrasing the input question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these points, SubQA is a greate dataset to benchamrk review-based QA models, sicne user-generated content in the example resembles what we might encounter in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** QA systems are categorized accordig to the domains it has access to while answering the questions. \n",
    "  * *Narrow QA* answers question about a single product less documents to search\n",

    "\n",
    " The (question, review, [answer setences]) format of SubjQA(used in [7-question-answering.ipynb notebook usecase for qa](../notebooks/7-question-answering.ipynb)) is commonly used in extractive QA datasets and was pioneered in Stanford Question Answering Dataset(SQuAD). \n",
    "\n",
    " * SQuAD is a famous dataset to test the abilit of machines(models) to read a passage of text and answer questions about it\n",
    " * This dataset was created from several hundred articles from wikipedia, where each of the article was partioned into paragraphs. Then crowdworkers were asked to generate questions and answers for each paragraph.\n",
    " * In the first crowdworkers version of SQuAD, answers for questions were guaranteed to be in paragraphs.\n",
    " * Soon sequence to sequence models outperformed humans and predicted spans of answers for question in the context(paragraphs, reviews etc.)\n",
    " * SQuAD 2.0 was created by augmenting SQuAD 1.1 with a set of adversial questions that were relevant to the passage but can't be answered from the passage contents alone. This became a better benchmark for evaluation qa capabalities of machines.\n",
    " * SOTA models as of 2022 with most models since 2019 surpasses human performance.\n",
    "    *qa sota models timeline*\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![alt](../notes/images/7-question-answering/qa-sota-models.png)\n",
    "* However this superhuman performance does not appear to reflect genuine reading comprehension, since answers to these \"unanswerable\" questions can be found by looking at antonymns in passages. \n",
    "* To address these problems Google released the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset which involves fact-seeking questions obtainef from Google Search users.\n",
    "* The answers in NQ are much longer than in SQuAD and present a more challenging benchmark.\n",

    "In general we'll start with a pretrained model and evaluate it on the dataset to use it as a baseline and then fine-tune the model for the use case. But for extractive QA , we can actually start with fine-tuned model because the structure of labels remain the same. Since our training set is realtivley small with only 1,295 samples, A good strategy is to use a model fine-tuned on large-scale QA dataset like SQuAD.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our example above, we've fed the pipeline or model both question and context. But in reality we'll get only the query from user and we've get the context from our corpus. There are few ways to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple and easiest approach is to concatenate all the reviews available as a single context and feed it with question to the model. The bottleneck will be the computation to process, because the context is big due to concatenation. Let's assume it takes 100 milliseconds to process a review with 30 reviews and the model will take 3 seconds latency after users input which won't work in an ecommerece application.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, moder QA system uses retriever-reader approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retriever-Reader architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Retriever is responsible for retrieving relevant documents for the user query. They are categorized as sparse and dense\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Sparse Retrievers*: This uses word frequencies to represent a document. The query is also a sparse vector. The relevancy of document for the query is determined by computing an inner product of both vectors.\n",
    "2. *Dense Retrievers*: This stores documents as contextualized embeddings. The query is converted into a dense vector using encoder like transformers. Then both query and documents are compared, semantic meaning is available with embeddings. This allows for a more accurate search of documents by understanding the content of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reader\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsible for extracting an answer from the documents provided by the retriver. These can be reading comprehension models(extract answers from text) or free-form answers from generative tranformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be post-processing after retriver or reader and both as well. Like ranking the documents from retriever to remove noisy passages or postprocessing answer by combining answer from various passages in a long document.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to retriever and reader an QA system requires two more components:\n",

I don\\'t get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I\\'ve had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother\\'s tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7\" is just perfect for me. It\\'s light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it\\'s fresh on my mind, and I\\'m reviewing everything I read.I didn\\'t realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I\\'ve always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I\\'ve even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what\\'s on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn\\'t last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn\\'t take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I\\'ve been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly. I can tolerate it for short periods to play a few games. However, I simply can\\'t hold the Kindle Fire long enough for reading.

The Sony MDRV6 excells as the best value of any headphone that I've ever owned.  They are especially good at producing natural-sounding deep bass, and the overall octave-to-octave balance is excellent.  The sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably more.The MDRV6 is especially well-suited for travel due to the collapsible design, and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by open-back headphones would distract others.The MDRV6 is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones, but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from BeyerDynamic.  The pads that come on the MDRV6 have a non-breathable cover, and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad, which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone.  This forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear, which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable.  I read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads (which eventually come apart) with a velour pad made by BeyerDynamic, and after I did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad, the increase in comfort was so great that I immediately did the other pair.  The thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place, which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad, which is considerably more comfortable.  I can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones.  Even if you don't replace the pads with the BeyerDynamic velour pads, I suggest removing the pads anyway, then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad, and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surface.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'meta': {}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'score': None, 'embedding': None}, 'is_correct_answer': True, 'is_correct_document': True, 'origin': 'gold-label', 'answer': {'answer': 'I have been a headphone fanatic for thirty years', 'type': 'extractive', 'score': None, 'context': None, 'offsets_in_document': None, 'offsets_in_context': None, 'document_ids': None, 'meta': {}}, 'pipeline_id': None, 'created_at': '2023-09-19 06:35:34', 'updated_at': None, 'meta': {}, 'filters': {'item_id': ['B00001WRSJ'], 'split': ['test']}}>\n"

It makes a world of difference in how much more air can flow through under the pad and up to your laptop. Also, beware of using this on top of a table cloth - it seems to impede air flow as well.

       "   'content': 'In most demanding games, my GPU will consistently soar to 90-93 degrees Celsius. I didn\\'t like seeing temps in the 90s so I figured I would pick up this Cooler Master for a shade over $20. Is it worth it? I think it is.My Sager NP8130 is 15.6\" and this cooler fits it just about perfectly - I have maybe 1\" of extra room. My laptop\\'s rubber stops on the bottom keep it anchored pretty well, and the fan itself isn\\'t super loud. There is an adjustable dial to change fan speed, but when I\\'m gaming, I generally just have it on max, and when I\\'m not gaming, I turn the cooling pad off altogether.The one thing I would make sure you do is use the little legs on the bottom of the cooling pad to prop it up an extra half inch or so. It makes a world of difference in how much more air can flow through under the pad and up to your laptop. Also, beware of using this on top of a table cloth - it seems to impede air flow as well. With the legs propping up the cooling pad, my GPU temps only hit about 84-86 degrees, but without it propped up, my GPU is still 90-91 degrees.Overall, it\\'s a small ~$20 investment to potentially increase the life of my laptop as a whole.',\n",

    "Can we get good scores with less k? The advantage of doing so is that we can pass fewer documents and reduce the overall latency of QA pipeline. A well-known limitation of sparse retrievers is that they fail to capture relevant documents when the words in user query doesn't match the exact terms in review. One promising alternative is to use dense representations fo document and query. The current state of the art architecture known as *Dense Passage Retrieval(DPR)*. The main idea behind DPr is to use a BERT encoder for question and document. The encoders map the input into a d-dimensional vector representation of the `[CLS]` token.\n",

The Sony MDRV6 excells as the best value of any headphone that I've ever owned.  They are especially good at producing natural-sounding deep bass, and the overall octave-to-octave balance is excellent.  The sound quality is all in all comparable to other headphones that cost considerably more.The MDRV6 is especially well-suited for travel due to the collapsible design, and for noisy environments or for quiet environments such as a library where the sound emitted by open-back headphones would distract others.The MDRV6 is not quite as comfortable as some other headphones, but the comfort can be improved enormously by replacing the pads with the velour pads from BeyerDynamic.  The pads that come on the MDRV6 have a non-breathable cover, and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad, which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone.  This forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear, which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable.  I read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads (which eventually come apart) with a velour pad made by BeyerDynamic, and after I did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad, the increase in comfort was so great that I immediately did the other pair.  The thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place, which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad, which is considerably more comfortable.  I can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones.  Even if you don't replace the pads with the BeyerDynamic velour pads, I suggest removing the pads anyway, then carefully separating the thin cover from the pad, and glueing the cover directly to the headphone surface.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a73f54ddc5b1fcc7f4fbf04bd564a278'}>,\n",

       "  'context': 'To anyone who hasn\\'t tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they\\'re good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer\\'s sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they\\'re very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn\\'t find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn\\'t get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn\\'t catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it\\'s good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you\\'re into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I\\'ve certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I\\'d rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we\\'re talking about value, they\\'re a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you\\'re trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there\\'s really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.'},\n",

       "  'context': \"I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Panasonic to $100 Sony, with Sennheiser HD 433, 202, PX100 II (I really wanted to like these PX100-II, they were so very well designed), and even a Grado SR60 for awhile.  And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.  It's supposed to be for better compatibility with the iPods and iPhones out there.\"}]"

    "One interesting alternative to extracting spans of answers of text in a document is to generate them with a pretrained language model. This approach is called *abstractive or generative QA* and has the potential to produce better phrased answers than answers synthesized from mutliple passages. We'll breifly toucj on the current state of art: *retrieval-augmented generation* (RAG).\n",

The generator is a pretrained sequence-to-sequence transformer like T5 or BART that reciever latent vectors of documents from DPR then iterativley generates an anser based on the query and these documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of generator or RAG models:\n",
    "\n",
    "*RAG-Sequence*:\n",
    "Uses the same retrieved document to generate an complete answer. In particular, the top k documents are fed to the generator, which produces and output for each document, and the result is marginalized to obtain the best answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*RAG-token*:\n",
    "Uses different documents to generate each token in the answer. This allows the generator to synthesize evidence from multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use RAG-Token models as they have better performance than RAG-Sequence ones. We'll instatiate the generator from hasytack with a different set of params."

I had to have it when it first came out.  I\\'ve stopped doing that, but in this case I wish I had bought the first Fire.  From using a friend\\'s I was excited when they finally announced the second gen devices.  The original was simple to use and did most things I wanted it to.  This one is incredibly hard to figure out, even with years of techy experience and is more limited in its use.PROS -Feels solid and well built.Anti-glare screen is nice, and the screen is vibrant.  It\\'s not Retina, but then it didn\\'t cost like one so I\\'m OK with that.Some have reported it being slow and unresponsive, but I haven\\'t had much of a problem except when in apps I know have problems from them doing the same to my phone.  Videos streamed from Amazon look really good.Book reading is surprisingly good for a backlit screen.  Page turns are quick and although they lack the book like \"charm\" of the Kindle reader page turns it is an acceptable substitute.Screen brightness is good and you can see the screen pretty well outdoors.  I have turned off automatic screen brightness though.  I find the values it chooses too bright in most cases and have mine set slightly less than 50%.CONS -No AC adapter included.  Would that have really been that much of a stretch to include?No flash support.  UPDATE: Well...no official flash support.  Thanks to the comment from TomT below I was able to install both flash and my preferred browser (Dolphin) in a few minutes.  Google Flash 11.1 apk and follow the xda developer links...will walk you right through it.  Now if I can get Google Voice working so I can use sonar I\\'ll be a happy camper.  Have added a star since it was this easy.  That still doesn\\'t negate the fact that it should have been included in the first place with so many sites still using Flash.The charge and HDMI ports are on the long edge rather than the short as is on my other Kindles (and the original Fire I believe).  When you want to do HDMI out to a TV you can only turn it one way if you want to tilt it up which may, depending on the case you buy,  totally defeat the stand in the case.  In the case of the Marware leather rotating case you can\\'t close the case when charging because the ports are to the inside.Volume and On-Off buttons are flush with the case and almost impossible to find by feel.  Since the only visual cue for which way you are holding it is the camera lens this makes it difficult in a darkened room.No GPS.  This isn\\'t a deal breaker, but would have been nice.  I suppose they thought since it needs wireless people wouldn\\'t use it like that, but I could always turn on my phone\\'s Mobile Hotspot to use Google maps IF I had a GPS.The ads.  I own other Kindles and have never felt the need to turn them off.  They were unobtrusive and didn\\'t really affect my use of the device.  I even went for them occasionally.  The ones on the new Kindle are ridiculous.  Everywhere you turn they are in your face just waiting for an errant touch to purchase something you don\\'t mean to and taking up screen space. People who care for children or the elderly should be extra vigilant for unintended purchases.Lack of many apps in the app store that I use daily on my Android phone and would use on the Kindle if they were there.  It\\'s clear Amazon doesn\\'t want to take any chances that you might stream something online that doesn\\'t belong to them.  No TNT app, no USA app, no CW app.  I assume the others that I don\\'t use like HBO and Showtime aren\\'t there either?  No support for PowerDVD Remote and PowerDVD Mobile which would allow me to stream my own personal videos from my network rather than having to either upload them to the cloud or onto the device.  Can\\'t access my Dropbox either.  I use my phone as a remote constantly when streaming from my HTPC to my TV and I was hoping I could use the Kindle that way too.Apps that work perfectly well on my phone throw error after error on the Kindle\\'s \"special\" version. Examples: Words with Friends, no paid version and ads lock up the device.  Tweetcaster constantly throws the 350 connections per hour message and I am not a heavy user.  It throws this one when all I do is check it once in a while and have it set on manual refresh.  I ended up in Twitter Jail the first night I had the Kindle and I didn\\'t tweet a single thing!  Never had this happen on my phone.Every app you download results in a \"purchase\" email from Amazon...even the free ones.  I have an avalanche of them in my inbox just from setting it up.  (Yes, I know this happens for phones as well.  I make the comment to point it out to those that don\\'t know.  Amazon should have a better way worked out to handle this by now and since Kindle is part of their proprietary environment and since Kindle is a part of that this is part of owning one.)The Carousel? I hate it.  Everything goes on it as soon as you load or use it even if you don\\'t want it to.  There may be a way to fine tune this, but if there is I haven\\'t found it yet. I put a few favorite songs on the device for when I\\'m not near wireless and it showed each individual song on the Carousel. The UI is cluttered and as far as I can see there is no way to alter it to better serve your personal needs.  No way to clear the Carousel either.  You have to remove items one by one.  (If anyone knows how to change this please do let me know.)The main screen is obviously front loaded to get you to buy stuff..with the few things things that get around the spoon feeding of ads and buying stuff all the way to the right like photos and web.UPDATE:  I had not attempted to use the camera.  There is no software included to make use of the camera.  The User guide says you can download Skype and that it MAY work with other apps in the store, but there is no way to use it without downloading something and experimentation to see what apps might work with it.  Why include the camera if they aren\\'t going to give you something to help use it?No alarm clock app included.  Now I know there are apps that will do this, but it\\'s pretty much a basic inclusion on most mobile devices these days.Haven\\'t decided if I will return or wait and hope Amazon offers some software updates that make it more acceptable.  It\\'s a brilliant hardware upgrade hogtied by Amazon\\'s watered-down version of Android and the lack of basic apps like camera/alarm that we have all come to expect.

I suppose they thought since it needs wireless people wouldn\\'t use it like that, but I could always turn on my phone\\'s Mobile Hotspot to use Google maps IF I had a GPS.The ads.  I own other Kindles and have never felt the need to turn them off.  They were unobtrusive and didn\\'t really affect my use of the device.  I even went for them occasionally.  The ones on the new Kindle are ridiculous.  Everywhere you turn they are in your face just waiting for an errant touch to purchase something you don\\'t mean to and taking up screen space. People who care for children or the elderly should be extra vigilant for unintended purchases.Lack of many apps in the app store that I use daily on my Android phone and would use on the Kindle if they were there.  It\\'s clear Amazon doesn\\'t want to take any chances that you might stream something online that doesn\\'t belong to them.  No TNT app, no USA app, no CW app.  I assume the others that I don\\'t use like HBO and Showtime aren\\'t there either?  No support for PowerDVD Remote and PowerDVD Mobile which would allow me to stream my own personal videos from my network rather than having to either upload them to the cloud or onto the device.  Can\\'t access my Dropbox either.  I use my phone as a remote constantly when streaming from my HTPC to my TV and I was hoping I could use the Kindle that way too.Apps that work perfectly well on my phone throw error after error on the Kindle\\'s \"special\" version. Examples: Words with Friends, no paid version and ads lock up the device.  Tweetcaster constantly throws the 350 connections per hour message and I am not a heavy user.  It throws this one when all I do is check it once in a while and have it set on manual refresh.  I ended up in Twitter Jail the first night I had the Kindle and I didn\\'t tweet a single thing!  Never had this happen on my phone.Every app you download results in a \"purchase\" email from Amazon...even the free ones.  I have an avalanche of them in my inbox just from setting it up.  (Yes, I know this happens for phones as well.  I make the comment to point it out to those that don\\'t know.  Amazon should have a better way worked out to handle this by now and since Kindle is part of their proprietary environment and since Kindle is a part of that this is part of owning one.)The Carousel? I hate it.  Everything goes on it as soon as you load or use it even if you don\\'t want it to.  There may be a way to fine tune this, but if there is I haven\\'t found it yet. I put a few favorite songs on the device for when I\\'m not near wireless and it showed each individual song on the Carousel. The UI is cluttered and as far as I can see there is no way to alter it to better serve your personal needs.  No way to clear the Carousel either.  You have to remove items one by one.  (If anyone knows how to change this please do let me know.)The main screen is obviously front loaded to get you to buy stuff..with the few things things that get around the spoon feeding of ads and buying stuff all the way to the right like photos and web.UPDATE:  I had not attempted to use the camera.  There is no software included to make use of the camera.  The User guide says you can download Skype and that it MAY work with other apps in the store, but there is no way to use it without downloading something and experimentation to see what apps might work with it.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notbeook, we've explored differente retirevers, readers, generators and evaluated them with common metrics for such systems. The techniques we used on closed-domain QA(on single domain of electronice products) can be generalized to the open domain case. \n",

    "For more checkout cloudera's [QA series](https://oreil.ly/Fd6lc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying QA systems in the wils can be a tricky buisness to get right, a significant part of the values comes from providing users with useful search capabalities, followed by a extractive component.\n",

    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "*Generation* T5, RAG, GPT4\n",
    "*Extraction* Zero shot NER, domain adaptaion\n",
    "*Search* TF-IDF, BM25, DPR\n",

    "Other intersting idead include,\n",
    "* multiModal QA over multiple modalities like text, tables and images\n",
    "* QA over knowledge graph, where nodes correspond toi real-word entities and their relations are defined by the edges. \n",
    "* Automatic question generation as a way to do some supervised training using unlabeled data or data augmentation."
