One obvious apporach is annotate more data, but this is more expensive if each annotation has to be validated by a domain expert.\n",

If no unlabeled data is available, we can't annotate more data. In this case we can use few-shot learning or use the embeddings from a pretrained language model to perform lookups with a nearest neighbor search.\n",

These tags define issue type,product causing the issue, responsible team. Automating the process will have an big impact on productivity and enables the support teams to focus on helping the users.

For this we can use [SciKit-multilearn libaray](http://scikit.ml/), which is specifically setup for this purpose. First we've to transform the labels into a format model can process. We can use `MultiLabelBinarizer` class from SciKit-learn. which accepts a list of labels and creates a vector with zeros for absent labels and ones for present labels. Let's test this by fit and tranform on `all_labels` to learn the mapping from label name to ID as follows:"

        "1. A baseline based on regular expressions or handcrafted rules might already work well, In this case no need to bring out transformers which is hard to maintain, deploy in production.\n",
        "2. The baselines provide quick checks and comparison as we explore more complex models. For example, if we achieve 80% accuracy on validation set with BERT we might write it off as a hard dataset. But what if we've a logistic regression baseline with 95% accuracy, we'll then investigate or debug what's wrong with the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "So let's start out analysis by training a baseline model. For text classification  great baseline is *Naive Bayes classifier* whicc is very simple and quick to train. sci-Kit Learn's Naive Bayes doesn't support multi label classification out of the box. But we can use Scikit-multilearn to cast the problem as one-vs-rest classification task where we train *L* binary classifiers for *L* labels.\n",
