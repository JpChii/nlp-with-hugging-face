        "# Dealing with Few to No Labels\n",
        "\n",
        "At the start of every project, the first question any data scientist asks? Is there any labelled data? Answer's mostly no or little bit. And on top of client's expectation that our fancy machine learning models should still perform well. One obvious apporach is annotate more data, but this is more expensive if each annotation has to be validated by a domain expert.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunaley there are several methods that are suited for dealing with few to no labels. Like *Zero-shot* in GPT-3 where it perfoms over a diverse range of tasks with a few dozen examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, the best-performing method will depend upon task, data, how much of the data is labeled.\n",
        "\n",
        "*The below picture will guide us through the process of picking the most appropriate method*\n",

        "Let's walk through this decision tree:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Is labeld data available?\n",
        "\n",
        "Evan a handful of labeled of labeled samples can make a difference with regards to which method works best. If no labeld data is available then we can start with zero-shot learning which often sets a strong baseline to work from.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How many labels?\n",
        "\n",
        "If we lots of labelled training data available then we can use the fine tuning approach used in [notebook 2](../notebooks/2-text-classification.ipynb)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Is there unlabeled data available?\n",
        "\n",
        "If we have a handful of labeled samples it can help immensley if we have access to large amounts ot unlabeled data. If we have access to unlabeled data, we can use it to fine-tune the language model on the domain before training the classifier, or use more sophisticated methods like unsupervised data augmentation(UDA) or uncertainy-aware self-training(UST). If no unlabeled data is available, we can't annotate more data. In this case we can use few-shot learning or use the embeddings from a pretrained language model to perform lookups with a nearest neighbor search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Int this notebook, we'll work our way through the decision tree by tackling a common problem facing many support teams that use issue trackers like Jira or Github to assist their users: tagging issues with metadata based on the issue's description. These tags define issue type,product causing the issue, responsible team. Automating the process will have an big impact on productivity and enables the support teams to focus on helping the users. In this notebook, we'll use issues associated with a populat open source project: Transformers. Let's now take a look at what information is available in these issues, what is the task and how to get the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** The methods used in this notebooks will work well for text classification, but other techniques such as data augmentation may be necessary for dealing with more complex tasks like named entity recognition, question answering or summarization."

For this we can use [SciKit-multilearn libaray](http://scikit.ml/), which is specifically setup for this purpose. First we've to transform the labels into a format model can process. We can use `MultiLabelBinarizer` class from SciKit-learn. which accepts a list of labels and creates a vector with zeros for absent labels and ones for present labels. Let's test this by fit and tranform on `all_labels` to learn the mapping from label name to ID as follows:"

For example, if we achieve 80% accuracy on validation set with BERT we might write it off as a hard dataset.
